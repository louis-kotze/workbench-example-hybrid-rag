ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

The objective is to evaluate quality of life, anxiety, and depression in
women with endometriosis, and to correlate these parameters with
pain intensity. This multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted
on 102 women with endometriosis from 2017 to 2020. The women
were divided into two groups according to the pain intensity: group
1 (severe pain, 62 women) and group 2 (mild/moderate pain, 40
women). The Endometriosis Health Profile Questionnaire, Beck
Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory were used to
assess quality of life and levels of anxiety and depression, respec­
tively. In both groups, mean age and mean body mass index were
similar (p˃ 0.5). Most women had deep endometriosis and were on
treatment, but group 2 had a longer treatment time (p = 0.044).
Group 1 exhibited more depression and anxiety than group 2
(17.1 ± 9.98 vs. 11.15 ± 9.25, p = 0.003 and 23.71 ± 12.92 vs
12.58 ± 10.53, p = 0.001, respectively). Women with high pain had
a significantly worse quality of life than those with low pain
(48.88 ± 16.02 vs. 23.32 ± 15.93, p < 0.001). Women with endome­
triosis and high pain intensity have a worse quality of life, and more
severe levels of anxiety and depression.

Introduction
Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory, estrogen-dependent disease, which is char­
acterized by the presence of endometrial, glandular, and/or stromal tissue outside the
uterine cavity (Schweppe et al., 2013). The incidence of endometriosis among women in
menacme ranges from 6% to 10% (Burney & Giudice, 2012). Symptoms vary, and include
pain and infertility, with a significant impact on women’s quality of life in the physical,
psychological, social, and sexual spheres (Della Corte et al., 2020). In this context,
depression and anxiety are strongly associated with endometriosis in women (Culley
et al., 2013; Sepulcri Rde & Do Amaral, 2009).
Some studies correlate stressful events correlated with the disease with the impairment
of the mental health of these women (Pope et al., 2015; Zarbo et al., 2017). Studies discuss

a vicious cycle of maintenance of pain and negative feelings related to this symptom that
significantly impact the mental health of women with endometriosis (Lagana et al., 2017;
Zarbo et al., 2019).
Globally, endometriosis affects women’s quality of life (QoL) and sexual function,
both physically and emotionally. The mental health of women with endometriosis can be
affected by physical factors such as pain and by women’s personal factors (Facchin et al.,
2017). It is still questioned how much pain can compromise the emotional aspects of
these women. Thus, this study aimed to assess QoL, anxiety, and depression in women
with endometriosis, in addition to correlating these parameters with intensity of pain.

Methods
A multicenter cross-sectional study was carried out on 102 women with endometriosis
who were followed up at the University of Campinas and at Pérola Byington Hospital
from December 2017 to December 2020.
Women aged between 18 and 40 years, without infertility, and with a surgical or
clinical diagnosis of endometriosis [based on imaging tests such as transvaginal ultra­
sound with bowel preparation (Guerriero et al., 2016) or magnetic resonance imaging
(Medeiros et al., 2015)] were included. Women with cognitive deficits that make it
impossible to understand the questionnaires, those with chronic diseases that can affect
QoL (such as rheumatoid arthritis, heart diseases, hematological diseases such as sickle
cell anemia, kidney disease, liver disease, neuropathies, and multiple sclerosis), women
diagnosed with psychiatric disorders such as mood disorders including depression,
bipolar disorder, or generalized anxiety disorder before the diagnosis of endometriosis,
and women in the recent postoperative period (less than 6 months) were excluded.
The variables evaluated were age, race (white or non-white), education (primary
education or higher), income (calculated with respect to the minimum wage which was
R$ 1,045.00), professional activity (employed or not [unemployed, housewives, and
students]), marital status, number of pregnancies, parity, number of children, religion
(yes or no), body mass index (BMI: calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters), smoking (yes or no), physical activity (yes or no), frequency
of physical activity (days per week), treatment used (estrogen and progestin hormone
therapy), previous surgeries (laparotomy or laparoscopy), pain symptoms (dysmenor­
rhea, chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dyschezia, and dysuria), anxiety, depression,
and QoL.
Pain symptoms were assessed using the visual analog pain scale (VAS), which is scored
from 0 to 10, where 0 is painless and 10 is the highest pain intensity experienced by the
women. Pain was classified as mild when the score was 1–3, moderate when the score was
4–7, and severe when it was greater than 7. The women were divided into two groups
according to their symptoms, and the women who presented severe pain scores were
grouped into the severe pain (group 1, n = 62, women with VAS>7), while women who
had mild-to-moderate pain scores were included in the group with mild/moderate pain
(group 2, n = 40, women with VAS ≤7). The VAS refers to the last month before the
interview.
The degree of endometriosis was defined as superficial (lesions with invasion less than
5 mm from the peritoneal surface) and deep (lesions located more than 5 mm from the

662

peritoneal surface, usually located in the uterosacral ligaments, Douglas pouch, rectova­
ginal septum, rectum, and sigmoid). All women underwent a transvaginal ultrasound
with intestinal preparation or magnetic resonance imaging to assess the presence of
profound endometriosis; when the examination showed no changes and the clinical
picture was suggestive of endometriosis, laparoscopy was performed to confirm the
diagnosis of endometriosis. Thus, we evaluated superficial and deep endometriosis.
Depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). It consists of 21
items, including symptoms and attitudes, which are scored from 0 to 3. The classification
was defined as no depression (less than 10 points), mild depression (10–18 points),
moderate depression (19–29 points), and severe depression (30–63 points; A T Beck
et al., 1961).
Anxiety was assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). It is composed of 21
items, with a score from 0 to 3, which reflect the symptoms of anxiety in a somatic,
affective, and cognitive manner. Such symptoms are considered common in anxiety
disorders, and are assessed by asking the degree to which the subject was affected by
each of them during the past week. The final score is indicative of the degree of anxiety,
which is classified as minimum anxiety (0–7 points), mild anxiety (8–15 points), mod­
erate anxiety (16–25 points), and severe anxiety (26–63 points; AT Beck et al., 1988).
QoL was assessed using the Endometriosis Health Profile Questionnaire (EHP-30).
The questionnaire was divided into two parts. The core questionnaire consists of five
subscales: pain, control and powerlessness, emotional well-being, social support, and selfimage. The second modular part of the questionnaire was not always applicable. It
consists of six subscales: work, relationship with children, sexual intercourse, infertility,
medical profession, and treatment. The scores are transformed in a range of 0 to 100
(total score EHP-30 core questionnaire 0–500), in which a higher score corresponds to
a lower disease-specific QoL. If an item in a subscale was not answered, no score could be
calculated for that subscale (Jones et al., 2001; Mengarda et al., 2008).
All women signed an informed consent form before participation in the study. This
study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the institution (number: 4
348 487).

Statistical analysis
The chi-square test and Fisher’s exact test were used to test the association between
categorical variables. The Mann-Whitney test was used to test the association between
continuous variables. Spearman’s correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relation­
ship between the numerical variables. Variables are reported as mean standard deviation
(SD). Calculate the effect size of the comparisons were calculated. For numerical variables
we use Cohen’s d and for categorical variables Cohen’s h. A probability value (P value) of
<0.05 was considered statistically significant. SAS version 9.04 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC) was
used for all statistical analyses.

Results
Women in group 1 had a mean age of 33.89 ± 5.71 years, and an average BMI of
27.60 ± 4.54 kg/m2, while those in group 2 had a mean age of 33.85 ± 5.60 years and

PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE

663

an average BMI of 26.27 ± 4.85 kg/m2 (p = 0.953 and 0.106, respectively). Women in
group 1 had a higher number of pregnancies and children compared to those in group 2
(p < 0.001). There was no difference in physical activity, professional activity, and income
between the groups (p = 0.656, 0.357, and 0.190, respectively). In both groups, most
women had deep endometriosis and were receiving treatment, although group 2 had
a longer treatment time (p = 0.044). (Table 1).
Women in group 1 had higher scores for depression and anxiety than those in group 2
(17.1 ± 9.98 vs. 11.15 ± 9.25, p = 0.003 and 23.71 ± 12.92 vs. 12.58 ± 10.53, p = 0.001
respectively). Women in group 1 had a significantly worse QoL compared to group 2
(48.88 ± 16.02 vs. 23.32 ± 15.93, p < 0.001), with the worst results in terms of both
physical and psychological scores (Table 2).
While analyzing the correlation of anxiety and depression with QoL, it was observed
that in women belonging to group 1, the lower the intensity of depression, the greater the
QoL (p < 0.001). Regarding anxiety, it was observed that women with lower levels of
anxiety also had a better QoL (p < 0.001). When women in group 2 were analyzed, it was
observed that the lower the level of depression and anxiety, the better the QoL (p = 0.0063
and p = 0.0095, respectively; Table 3).

Discussion
The age of the women in this study ranged from 28 to 34 years, and this age range was
similar to that reported in previous literature (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Minson et al.,
2012). In our study population, most women had deep endometriosis (91.18%); however,
there are few articles in the literature that distinguish this variable (Yela et al., 2020).
Although most women in our study had deep endometriosis, some studies have shown
that there is no correlation between the symptoms and stage of endometriosis (Marinho

et al., 2018; Minson et al., 2012; Sepulcri Rde & Do Amaral, 2009). We observed that
women with low pain scores had longer treatment times, which could justify the better
symptoms compared to the group with high pain scores. In the high pain group, women
had shorter treatment times, which can be explained by the greater number of pregnan­
cies among these women, longer periods without hormonal drugs to become pregnant,
and during the gestational period.
Women in group 2 had better quality of life than those in group 1 when we evaluated
the total EHP-30 score. When we evaluated the fertility domain, we observed that women
in group 2 had a worse quality of life in this domain. This can be explained by the fact that
in this group most women did not have children. Thus, despite infertility having an impact
on quality of life, the symptom of pain seems to be more relevant than that of infertility in
quality of life. Another Brazilian study shows pain as a symptom that impacts the quality
of life of women with endometriosis and infertility (Rodrigues et al., 2020).
Women with lower levels of depression and anxiety had a better QoL. A recent
systematic review also showed an inversely proportional correlation of depression and
anxiety with quality of life in women with endometriosis (Wang et al., 2021). We also
observed that women with severe pain had worse levels of anxiety and depression, similar
to the results of previous studies (Warzecha et al., 2020). A study of 109 women with
endometriosis showed that 86.5% of women had depression and 87.5% anxiety, with
a positive correlation between the symptom intensity and worsening of anxiety (Sepulcri
Rde & Do Amaral, 2009). Another study comparing the prevalence of depression among
women with endometriosis observed that women with pain had more depression (86%)
than those without pain (38%; Lorençatto et al., 2006).
All the women underwent treatment in the present cohort. Our results showed that
there was no statistical difference in the income, profession, religion, physical activity, or
BMI between women with and without pain. Thus, we can infer that the groups were
homogeneous in relation to the variables that could interfere with the women’s emo­
tional well-being.

M. DE BARROS MENEGUETTI ET AL.

Regarding QoL, our study observed that women with severe pain had worse QoL
scores than women with mild pain, which is in agreement with the findings of previous
studies (Della Corte et al., 2020; Souza et al., 2011). However, not all studies used the
EHP-30 questionnaire to assess the QoL in women with endometriosis. Some studies
used the SF-36 questionnaire, but on comparing the results of the two questionnaires, it
was observed that the results were similar (Bourdel et al., 2019; Minson et al., 2012). It is
observed that women who are treated with hormonal therapy with pain symptom control
have a better QoL, as was noted with the women with a longer treatment time (group 2)
in our study (Grandi et al., 2019; Rindos et al., 2020). A study that evaluated the
perception and intensity of pain in women with endometriosis showed that those with
worse pain perception (score ≥ 4) had a worse QoL and greater psychological impairment
(Van Aken et al., 2017).
As in our study, existing literature supports the notion that women with a higher
level of pain have a lower QoL (Souza et al., 2011), although only the physical QoL is
related to physical pain (Sepulcri Rde & Do Amaral, 2009). According to the mediation
models, increased physical pain and difficulties in emotion regulation can both lead to
increased psychological stress, which is associated with a deterioration in the QoL. The
main goal of treatment is to reduce the pain symptoms in order to improve the QoL,
along with decreasing the societal burden and healthcare costs of endometriosis (Márki
et al., 2017).
Women with endometriosis may experience a wide range of pelvic pain.
Nevertheless, pain and pain-related distress seem to be independent of the stage of
endometriosis, suggesting that psychosocial factors may be involved in the pain
experience of women with endometriosis. In particular, controlled cross-sectional
studies have shown that women with endometriosis report heightened psychological
distress, including guilt toward their partner, lower feelings of femininity, alteration of
body image, feelings of loss of control over one’s own body, worthlessness, hope­
lessness, and alexithymia. Compared to healthy women, women with endometriosis
reported significantly higher levels of pain catastrophizing, stress, depression, and
anxiety, with prevalence rates up to 87% (Sepulcri Rde & Do Amaral, 2009; Van
Aken et al., 2017).
This study has some limitations, such as the absence of a control group without
endometriosis and the small sample size. Thus, pain control improves QoL of women
with endometriosis. Emotional repercussions, such as anxiety and depression, affect these
women regardless of the pain symptoms, although this impairment is proportional to
pain intensity.
So, based on our results, we can suggest that pain leaves a negative impression on
women that, even when treated, compromises their mental health. Thus, it is important
that women with endometriosis are approached in a multidisciplinary way to try to
minimize and treat the damage to their physical and mental health. A systematic review
shows the association of endometriosis and depression and points to chronic pain as the
main cause, but I argued that depressive symptoms are also modulated by the social
context and vulnerability of individuals and suggests that these women be treated in
a personalized way (Gambadauro et al., 2019).
In conclusion, women with endometriosis and pain experience more severe anxiety
and depression. QoL is inversely proportional to intensity of pain symptoms.
