Background: Endometriosis is characterized by lesions of endometrial tissue outside
the uterus. Chronic pain is considered as main symptom, but challenges can relate to
various physical, mental, and social aspects of the women’s lives. The aim of our study
was to gain a holistic understanding of the everyday reality of women with endometriosis
compared to healthy controls.
Methods: The total sample comprised 12 hormone-free endometriosis patients (EP) and
11 age-matched healthy women (HC). A mixed-methods design was used comprising
semi-structured interviews, standardized questionnaires and a comprehensive diary to
assess pain ratings and various mental and physical symptoms over the course of
a menstrual cycle. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and evaluated according to
phenomenological analysis using the MAXQDA software.
Results: Interviews showed that living with endometriosis was associated with an
impairment in everyday life. Physical strains, especially pain, high levels of psychological
distress, and social limitations have been reported. Living with endometriosis affected the
patients’ personality and they “no longer felt like themselves.” Physical and psychological
symptoms were reported to interfere with social interaction and participation. Evaluation
of the standardized questionnaires revealed significant impairments in EP compared to
HC in regard to anxiety and depression scores (both p < 0.001; Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale), mental and physical quality of life (both p < 0.001; Short-Form Health
Survey-12), stress ratings (p < 0.001; Patient Health Questionnaire-15) and functional
well-being (p < 0.001; Functional Well-being-7). The highest levels of mean pelvic pain
and dyschezia were observed in EP during menstruation, but mean pain ratings and
dyschezia were increased in EPs compared to HP during the whole cycle. EP reported
mental symptoms (e.g., depressed mood or anxiety) mainly during menstruation, while
HC did not show any mental symptoms during the cycle. In addition, physical symptoms
were elevated during the entire cycle in EPs (all p < 0.01).

Experiences of Women With Endometriosis

Discussion: The mixed-methods approach enabled to interpret the interviews, the
standardized questionnaires, and the symptom diary in a broader context of everyday
life. The symptoms do not appear to act independently, but rather influence each other.
This leads to a complex interplay of physical, mental, and social impairments, with pain
often being the starting point.
Keywords: endometriosis, mixed-methods design, everyday-experiences, symptom diary, interviews, bio-psychosocial model

INTRODUCTION

The aim of the present study was to gain a holistic
understanding of the everyday condition of (hormone-free)
women with endometriosis. In order to meet the complexity of
the research question, method triangulation was used, i.e., both
quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied (29). To our
knowledge, this is the first mixed-methods study to collect data
from women with endometriosis on a daily basis over the course
of a menstrual cycle.
Comprehensive pain ratings (e.g., pelvic pain, dyspareunia,
dyschezia) were assessed. In addition, since endometriosis
patients have been shown to suffer not only from pain,
but also from numerous physical symptoms as well as
mental problems such as depression or anxiety, we also
assessed the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder
(PMDD) on a daily basis (30). PMDD symptoms comprise
depressed mood, anxiety, anger, emotional instability, loss of
interest, lethargy, difficulty concentrating, change in appetite,
hypersomnia/insomnia, perceived loss of control, and physical
symptoms (breast discomfort, joint or muscle pain, a sensation
of “bloating” or weight gain) (31). Diary data were supplemented
with data from standardized questionnaires collected during
the menstrual phase: The Hospital Anxiety and Depression
Scale (HADS) (32), State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)
(33, 34), 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) (35), the
somatic and stress scales from the Patient Health Questionnaire
(PHQ-15) (36), and Functional Well-being (FW-7) (37). In
order to better understand the interplay of the individual
symptoms and to learn more about the individual impact of the
physical and mental symptoms on the women’s everyday life,
additional semi-structured interviews were conducted with the
endometriosis patients.

Endometriosis is a complex, inflammatory disease, characterized
by lesions of endometrial tissue outside the uterus (1–
4). Endometriosis has an estimated prevalence of 6–15%
of women in their reproductive age worldwide (5–7). The
etiology of endometriosis is not fully understood (8). There are
several hypotheses regarding the etiopathogenetic mechanisms
of endometriosis; the most widely accepted transportation
theory assumes that viable endometrial cells circulate back
during menstruation through the tubes (menstrual reflux) and
cluster at neighboring pelvic structures (9). In addition to
a presumed multifactorial etiology, which is not yet fully
understood, and the lack of a curative treatment, there are
many other unanswered questions (10, 11). Further challenges
include the diagnostic process, which requires laparoscopic
procedures, and the often massively delayed diagnosis (8 years on
aver-age) (12, 13).
Endometriosis manifests at various levels, e.g., anatomic,
histologic, or immunologic (3), as well as with a variety
of different symptoms (e.g., chronic fatigue or bladder- and
bowel-associated symptoms) and comorbidities (e.g., depression)
(14–17). Chronic pain (e.g., pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, or
dyspareunia) and infertility are considered the main symptoms
(17), but the complaints faced by women with endometriosis
may relate to various physical, emotional, and social aspects
of the women’s daily lives (10, 14, 18–20). Current treatment
approaches for pain and infertility (e.g., hormonal drugs or
repeated surgical procedures) are not always effective and are
often associated with unpleasant side effects (21, 22). In addition,
there is no direct association between histologic findings and
disease symptoms, and disease progression is difficult to predict
(3, 23).
Several studies have reported reduced quality of life in women
with endometriosis, characterized by constraining physical
conditions as well as negative emotions such as uncertainty,
anxiety, or depressive symptoms (14, 16, 18, 24). In most of
these studies, patient-reported outcomes were measured at only
a single time point during the menstrual cycle and focused
on either mental or physical well-being, mostly related to pain
(25–28). Cross-sectional studies bear the risk of recall bias or
loss of relevant information. There is insightful research that
examines pain using an electronic diary to gather information
about the “day-to-day” experience (23–25), which seems to be
a worthwhile method to show the course of symptoms over an
entire menstrual cycle.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Study Design and Sample
A prospective observational study was performed in 12
endometriosis patients (EP) and 11 age-matched healthy
controls (HC). A mixed-methods design was applied, comprising
semi-structured interviews, standardized questionnaires, and a
comprehensive diary to assess pain ratings and PMDD symptoms
(30). The study also included the collection of menstrual
and venous blood to evaluate immunological changes [results
reported elsewhere (38)]. The study protocol was approved by the
ethical committee of the Medical Faculty at LMU Munich (no.
17-695) and the research was performed in accordance with the

Material and Measures

principles of GCP/Declaration of Helsinki. All study participants
gave written informed consent.
Between January 2018 and August 2019, women with
histologically confirmed endometriosis and age matched healthy
volunteers without endometriosis or menstrual pain were
recruited. Inclusion criteria were the following: Age between 18
and 45 years, regular menstrual cycle and sufficient knowledge
of German language. Further inclusion criteria for the patients
with endometriosis was biopsy-confirmed endometriosis. An
additional criterion was related to maximum pelvic pain during
the last three menstrual cycles (dysmenorrhea) assessed by
a numeric rating scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain
imaginable): Inclusion criterion was 5 or more for patients
with endometriosis, and 3 or less for healthy controls. All
participants underwent gynecological examination in order to
confirm (EP) or exclude (HC) the presence of endometriosis. For
endometriosis patients, the stage of the disease according to the
Revised Classification of the American Society for Reproductive
Medicine (rASRM) (39) was assessed by reviewing the patients’
medical chart and confirmed/adapted during the gynecological
examination. Exclusion criteria for both groups were the
use of psychotropic drugs and/or manifest mental illness, a
malignant disease, the acute need of treatment of a gynecological
disease, medication with hormonal drugs, pregnancy, and
current breastfeeding.

Questionnaires
Standardized and widely used questionnaires were completed
during the menstrual phase to assess depression and anxiety
(HADS, STAI) (32–34), mental and physical quality of life (SF12) (35), physical symptoms and stress (PHQ-15) (36), and
well-being (FW-7) (37).

Symptom Diary
On a daily basis, participants rated their mean and maximum
pelvic pain, maximum alguria, maximum dyschezia, and
maximum dyspareunia on numeric rating scales (NRS, 0 =
no pain, 100 = maximum pain). In addition, the German
Premenstrual Symptom Inventory was applied to assess 27
symptoms that are frequently observed during a menstrual cycle
(42). Symptoms were assessed on 6-point Likert scales (0 =
not at all; 5 = extreme) (43) and mean scores were computed
for the following domains: depressed mood, anxiety, tension,
emotional instability, loss of interest, lethargy, fatigability, change
in appetite, hypersomnia/insomnia, loss of control, and physical
symptoms (breast discomfort, joint or muscle pain, a sensation
of “bloating” or weight gain). There were further questions about
the need of drugs (name and dosage of the drug), the presence of
menses or metrorrhagia (yes/no), and bleeding intensity (NRS, 0
= no bleeding; 100 = maximum bleeding).

Interviews

Procedure

The development of the semi-structured interview guide was
based on a literature review and allowed to conduct the
interviews as standardized as possible, while at the same time
leaving enough space for individual answers. Interviews were
conducted face-to-face and were audio-recorded, transcribed and
evaluated using the MAXQDA software (44, 45). To preserve
the integrity of the women, confidential data such as names or
location information were anonymized during transcription and
pseudonyms with consecutive identification numbers were used.
Data analysis was performed by two researchers (AW and AB)
using an interpretive-hermeneutic phenomenology approach.
The interviews lasted an average of 23.17 min.

EP were recruited through outpatient centers, and HC by
postings at local universities. In a detailed telephone call, the
aim and procedure of the study, voluntary participation, and
data protection were explained. Furthermore, the inclusion and
exclusion criteria were ascertained and any open questions
were answered. After signing informed consent, all participants
completed an online questionnaire that collected information
regarding demographics and disease history, resp. health
status. Already at the beginning of the study, it was clearly
communicated to the participants when the expected onset of
the menstruation and thus the start of the diary, as well as the
start of the second menstruation and the visit to the institute
for the interviews would take place. Participants informed
the research team at the first day of their next menses and
received an email that included a link to a comprehensive
survey to assess pain levels and PMDD symptoms. On each
day during the menstrual cycle, participants received a similar
email at the same time of day, depending on the time of
their first diary response. If a participant did not respond
within 12 h, a reminder email was automatically sent via the
RedCAP distribution tool (40, 41). RedCAP was set up in
such a way that every question had to be answered before
the questionnaire could be sent off, so that there was hardly
any missing data. At the time of their second menstruation,
participants were invited to the Institute of Medical Psychology
(LMU Munich) to conduct the semi-structured interviews faceto-face, and to complete a catalog of standardized questionnaires.
Healthy control subjects received an expense compensation
of 50 e.

Statistical Analyses
Quantitative data was analyzed by means of IBM SPSS Statistics
25, with a p ≤ 0.05 considered as significant. To compare baseline
characteristics as well as questionnaire scores between EP and
HC, independent-samples t-tests, Pearson’s chi-square-tests and
Mann-Whitney-U-Tests were performed, as appropriate. Diary
data were analyzed by non-parametric statistics. As the length
of the women’s cycles varied, the diary data was grouped
into three phases in order to enable better comparability: The
menstruation phase (MP; the individual mean value of all days
during menstruation), the premenstrual phase (PMP; mean value
of the 5 days prior to menstruation) and the intermediate phase
(IP; mean value of the days between the menstruation phase
and the pre-menstruation phase) (31, 46, 47). Pain ratings and
PMDD symptoms were compared between EP and HC for
each cycle phase using Mann-Whitney U-tests (p-values were
Bonferroni-corrected for the three cycle phases). Within-subject

uncorrected p-values).

months (±17.74 SD) and the rASRM score ranged between I and
IV (Table 1).

RESULTS

Non-parametric tests evaluating the results of the standardized
questionnaires revealed significant differences between EP and
HC in regard to anxiety and depression scores (both p < 0.05;
HADS), mental and physical quality of life (both p < 0.001; SF12) as well as physical symptoms and stress ratings (both p <
0.001; PHQ) and functional well-being (p < 0.05; FW-7), with
EPs showing higher burden and worse quality of life and wellbeing than HC. No significant group differences were found for
state anxiety (STAI; p = 0.17) (Table 1).

Standardized Questionnaires

Thirteen patients and 15 healthy subjects were eligible for the
study. One patient had to be excluded because of a planned
medical infertility treatment. Two healthy controls had to be
excluded because they were too young to be matched with a
patient. Two healthy controls reported significant menstrual pain
during the observation period and were excluded, as well. Finally,
11 patients and 12 healthy controls were included in the study.
EP and HC were comparable in regard to age, body mass
index, relationship status, and educational background (Table 1).
In EP, mean time since the first diagnostic surgery was 41.92

Symptom Diary
As shown in Table 2, the highest levels of mean and maximum
pelvic pain and dyschezia were observed in EP during the
menstruation phase. Maximum pain ratings were significantly
higher in the intermediate phase than in the premenstruation
phase only in EPs. HC reported mild pelvic pain only during the

menstruation phase. Group comparisons indicated higher ratings
of mean and maximum pain and dyschezia in EP compared with
HC during all three phases of the menstrual cycle. In addition,
maximum alguria was elevated in HC during the intermediate
phase compared with the menstruation phase but still lower than
in EP (Table 2).
As shown in Table 3, EP reported PMDD-associated
symptoms mainly during the menstruation phase, while HC did
not show any PMDD symptoms during the menstrual cycle.
Group comparisons revealed that EP were significantly more
likely than HC to report depressed mood, anxiety, affective
lability, anger/irritability, difficulty concentrating, lethargy,
hypersomnia/insomnia, perceived loss of control, and physical
symptoms during the menstruation phase. In addition, physical
symptoms were elevated during the entire cycle in EP compared
with HC (Table 3).

Qualitative Interviews
The qualitative interviews revealed that living with endometriosis
is associated with impairment in everyday life. Some women
described not being completely free of symptoms on any given
day and that their symptoms increased around menstruation.
Many interests or other needs were subordinated to the disease.
The following three main categories were identified: impact
on a physical level, a mental level, and a social level (see
Table 4): In addition to severe pain, women reported many
other physical symptoms, e.g., gastrointestinal and circulatory
problems, heavy bleeding, migraine, tightness in the chest, up to a
strong physical exhaustion. Most women described severe mental
distress, especially the perceived loss of control due to various
physical symptoms that often occurred unpredictably, and the
limited treatment options for endometriosis. Moreover, women
described a constant mental preoccupation with pain. Living with
endometriosis affected their personality and they no longer felt

Impact on physical level

• All physical symptoms perceived by the women:
◦ Pain, migraine, strong menstrual bleeding, etc.
◦ Sleeping problems
◦ Impaired functionality and activity

• “So for me, it was primarily the pain”
• “...always strong cramps, also at the sphincter and also
strong diarrhea and nausea”
• “...I just also have a bleed, that I know a sanitary towel and
a tampon, they’re both not going to hold anymore”

Impact on mental level (Impact on
personality)

• Impact on emotions and thoughts
• Restrictions in concentration, load capacity, and “scope of
action”
• Awareness of limited treatment options
• Occurrence of different, changing physical symptoms

• “…most of all the psychological strain, actually, that I can’t
plan”
• “so I am really there mega dissatisfied and also really
desperate. And I’ve never had feeling I’ve never had
before...”
• “and the not really existing conventional medical options,
because you just don’t have that much perspective in a
certain way”

Impact on social level (professional
level)

• Avoidance of social events, traveling etc. (staying at home)
• Impact on social relationships (intimate partnership)
• Impact on practicing the women’s professions

• “...my friend, that excites him, he can understand it a little
bit, but for him it’s also bad”
• “And what also bothers me a lot is, that I isolate myself so
much from other people”
• “And also at work, that bothers that I’m just not as resilient
as I used to be”
• “And I couldn’t go home by myself anymore either, my
colleagues had to drive me home”

control, or loss of concentration, were significantly increased,
indicating that endometriosis patients have to battle with many
other physical and psychological stresses in addition to pain.
PMDD symptoms were not elevated during the premenstrual
phase in either EP or HC, suggesting that PMDD per se has
not occurred in this cohort, which is in agreement with the
exclusion criterion of mental illness. Nevertheless, patients
showed the highest levels of physical symptoms during the
premenstrual period.
In order to avoid the sole evaluation of a priori predefined
categories and to offer the opportunity to speak freely and
openly about their experiences, semi-structured interviews were
conducted with the endometriosis patients. The face-to-face
interviews showed that living with endometriosis was associated
with manifold impairment in everyday life. Physical strains,
especially pain, high levels of psychological distress, and social
limitations were reported. Living with endometriosis affected the
women’s personality and they “no longer felt like themselves.”
The constant physical, emotional, and cognitive preoccupation
with pain appears to result in a number of other mental and
social negative consequences. The recognition that, in addition to
other physical symptoms, pain serves as a kind of “starting point”
for a whole series of associated and mutually influencing mental
and social strains has also been described in previous studies
(5, 20, 28, 49, 50). Furthermore, discomfort fluctuated over
time, sometimes unpredictably, creating tremendous uncertainty
and avoidance behavior. In their systematic review, Gao et al.
identified pain, psychosocial functioning, and social functioning
as particularly affected domains in women with endometriosis,
and the present results further support this conclusion. However,
in the present study, the influence of other fluctuating physical
symptoms (e.g., nausea or exhaustion) across the entire cycle
became additionally evident (51).

like themselves. Patients reported impaired social interactions
(e.g., their intimate relationships), restricted participation in
daily life (e.g., travel or participating at events) and impaired
occupational performance. As a result, avoidance behavior was
reported, and patients increasingly withdrew in order to recover.

DISCUSSION
Endometriosis is a chronic disease that is often associated with
pelvic pain. However, this does not do justice to the day-to-day
reality of women with endometriosis, who are confronted with
variety of symptoms that often appear suddenly and interact
with each other. The aim of the present study was to gain a
holistic understanding of the everyday reality of women with
endometriosis. For this purpose, a mixed-methods design was
used to collect information on different levels and relate them to
each other.
The standardized questionnaires yielded worse results
for the patients compared to healthy controls. Accordingly,
endometriosis patients showed significantly higher depression
and anxiety scores (HADS) during menstruation, as well as a
reduced mental and physical quality of life (SF-12, FW-7), more
stress as well as more physical symptoms (PHQ-15). This is
not only in accordance with previous studies (18, 20, 48, 49),
but was further confirmed by the detailed diary survey, which
provided the opportunity to observe symptom fluctuations
over the entire menstrual cycle. By pseudonymizing the diary
entries, biases induced by social desirability could be avoided.
It was very impressively demonstrated that patients reported
significantly more pelvic pain (up to 80 on NRS 0-100) and
further physical symptoms throughout the menstrual cycle.
During menstruation all PMDD associated symptoms (except
for changes in appetite) such as depression, anxiety, loss of

Experiences of Women With Endometriosis

DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT

The current study is limited by the relatively small and
heterogenous sample; a larger sample size would have been
desirable. Especially time since diagnosis varied considerably
among patients [on average 41.92 months (±17.74)]. In
addition, disease-unrelated factors (e.g., disputes or professional
challenges) might have influenced the participants’ daily
condition and for instance might have led to concentration
difficulties or anxiety. The complex and comprehensive data
ensured a holistic picture of participants’ experiences, but
certainly also led to fatigue and habituation effects due to the
extensive questionnaires. Although the completion of the diary
was sometimes perceived as exhausting by the participants, it
was nevertheless manageable for them as it was predictable
and time-limited.
In conclusion, the multi-method approach of this study
revealed that pain and the associated cognitive and emotional
distress, as well as the unpredictable occurrence of symptoms,
led to significant impairment at the physical, mental, and social
levels in women with endometriosis; this process appears to
be reinforced by the lack of a curative therapy. Similar to
other chronic pain conditions (52), therapeutic approaches that
perceive the disease from a bio-psycho-social perspective should
be applied to reduce the negative impact of endometriosis
on women’s daily lives. Accordingly, a multimodal treatment
approach is warranted that includes not only drug treatment
and surgery, but also addresses the bio-psycho-social needs
of the patients (53). Future studies with larger samples and
longer observation times are needed to better understand the
fluctuations of daily symptoms in endometriosis patients over
time as well as the influence of individual factors, such as type of
endometriosis, treatment approach, and psychosocial stressors.

The raw data supporting the conclusions of this
article will be made available by the authors, without
undue reservation.
