RESEARCH

A thematic synthesis of qualitative studies
and surveys of the psychological experience
of painful endometriosis
Amanda C. de C Williams1* and Honor McGrigor1

Abstract
Background Endometriosis is a widespread problem in women of reproductive age, causing cyclical and non-cyclical pain in the pelvis and elsewhere, and associated with fatigue, fertility problems, and other symptoms. As a chronic
pain problem, psychological variables are important in adjustment and quality of life, but have not been systematically studied.
Methods A systematic search of multiple databases was conducted to obtain surveys and qualitative studies
of women’s experience of pain from endometriosis. Surveys were combined narratively; qualitative studies were combined by thematic synthesis, and the latter rated for methodological quality.
Results Over 2000 records were screened on title and abstract, and provided 22 surveys and 33 qualitative studies
from which accounts could be extracted of the psychological components of pain in endometriosis. Surveys mostly
addressed quality of life in endometriosis, with poorer quality of life associated with higher levels of pain and of distress, but few referred to coherent psychological models. Qualitative studies focused rather on women’s experience
of living with endometriosis, including trajectories of diagnosis and treatment, with a few addressing meaning
and identity. Thematic synthesis provided 10 themes, under the groupings of internal experience of endometriosis
(impact on body, emotions, and life); interface with the external world (through self-regulation and social regulation);
effects on interpersonal and social life, and encounters with medical care.
Conclusions The psychological components of pain from endometriosis only partly corresponded with standard
psychological models of pain, derived from musculoskeletal pain studies, with fewer fears about physical integrity
and more about difficulties of managing pain and other symptoms in social settings, including work. Better understanding of the particular psychological threats of endometriosis, and integration of this understanding into medical
care with opportunities for psychologically-based pain management, would substantially improve the experience
and quality of life of women with painful endometriosis.

Background
Endometriosis affects about 5–8% women of reproductive age [1–4]. Typical symptoms include dysmenorrhea,
noncyclic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, fatigue, pain on emptying the bladder or bowels, and heavy bleeding [5, 6].
Pain is not only felt in the pelvis, but can be localized to

various other parts of the body, such as the lower back.
Pain and other symptoms can be felt constantly, cyclically
with worsening around menstruation and/or ovulation
[6], or unpredictably, and they vary between and within
people with endometriosis. Additionally, endometriosis can be comorbid with other chronic (persistent) pain
conditions, including tension headache and migraine,
fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, vulvodynia, bladder pain,
and low back pain, often referred to as Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions (COPCs) and attributed to changes
in central sensitization [3, 7, 8].
Diagnosis is commonly delayed for several years after
symptom onset, and access to imaging or surgical diagnosis may be restricted by social inequalities [3] as well
as by limited knowledge of endometriosis in primary
care, with difficulty both for women and for healthcare
staff distinguishing endometriosis from putatively ‘normal’ dysmenorrhea [1, 9–11]. Following diagnosis, pain
reduction sometimes takes second place to treating the
condition, but neither size of lesions [12] nor stage of disease predicts frequency, constancy, or intensity of pain.
Finally, pain often persists or recurs after effective surgical, hormonal, or other treatments [13].
In any chronic pain scenario, psychological variables
are important in determining the personal experience of
chronic pain, overall adaptation, and prognosis [14, 15].
Difficulty living with chronic pain may or may not reach
clinical criteria for depression or anxiety [16], but tends
to be focused on pain and its implications for overall
health, including fertility, as well as on difficulties in everyday life and in lifetime goals. Intimate and social relationships are disrupted, as is work, with implications for
career and financial security. Women can find it hard to
communicate their pain and other symptoms, or to find
someone who has the appropriate skill to handle their
struggle [17]. Therefore, people with endometriosis may
become isolated and distressed [1, 18–20]. Overall, quality of life is reduced, although that is not necessarily routinely reflected in studies of natural history or treatment
outcome [21]. Additionally, its association with menstrual bleeding renders it stigmatized [19], while female
pelvic pains in general are at risk of being dismissed as
mental health problems (22, 17].
Within the broader biopsychosocial framework, the
dominant psychological model in chronic pain is that of
fear and avoidance [14, 22], whereby overestimation of
the threat inherent in pain for physical integrity leads to
avoidance of a wide range of activity, which in turn leads
both to increasing disability (through deconditioning)
and to depression (through losses inherent in avoidance).
Both anxiety about pain and damage and losses due to
restricted activity contribute to worsening of pain experience (particularly by descending modulation of pain) and

Page 2 of 16

to maintaining anxiety and restricted activity. However,
this is largely based on studies of musculoskeletal pain,
often low back pain, in which people with pain associate that pain with damage to essential joint and vertebral
structures, provoking caution around movement; for
instance, fewer than 10 of 335 studies of pain-related fear
and avoidance concerned visceral pain, and none endometriosis [23]. It is not clear to what extent the same psychological model applies to visceral pains, where fears of
damage may be less prominent, and fears of disease and
long-term prognosis where disease is diagnosed may be
far more salient; nor is it clear what activities are routinely avoided and how that affects everyday life in both
short and long term.
In early studies, very similar mood and social adjustment outcomes were found in women with diagnosed
endometriosis compared with those with negative laparoscopy for pelvic pain [24], and, despite a high level of
concern about undiagnosed disease, few gynecology
patients with pain endorsed worry about cancer [25].
No psychological models specific to endometriosis, or to
painful gynecological conditions, have developed, and a
2015 systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative research in endometriosis [26] noted the lack of
studies of emotional and social wellbeing. One review
since has provided more information on psychological impact of endometriosis. A narrative synthesis of 16
qualitative studies [1] described themes of powerlessness,
and of loneliness and isolation, but not of anxiety about
pain, and worry only in relation to infertility. A more
recent systematic review included meta-analyses showing higher depression and anxiety scores in women with
endometriosis when compared with healthy controls, but
not when compared with other women with chronic pelvic pain [16]; the focus of depression and anxiety were
not described, although their correlation in at least some
included studies with pain levels and fertility problems
was noted.
Several mixed methods or combined quantitative and
qualitative reviews add a little more detail of psychological problems associated with endometriosis. One,
on coping in women with endometriosis [27], reported
catastrophic thinking to be associated with more pain,
and “passive” coping and avoidance with poorer mental
health. This review [27] also sought studies of metacognition in women with endometriosis, but found none. The
same authors, in a large mixed method study, reported
that worry about pain, rumination and catastrophizing, were all associated with more distress [28], a result
consistent with another review of observational studies
[4] and a separate meta-analysis on stress and endometriosis [29]. The only review to take a social focus was
an account of stigma causing distress; family members,

de C Williams and McGrigor ﻿BMC Women’s Health

(2024) 24:50

clinicians, and others who believed endometriosis to
be no worse than period pain represented women who
struggled with endometriosis pain as exaggerating or
complaining excessively [19].
Overall, there is little theorising in this area about the
nature of distress or about the fit of existing psychological models of pain in women with painful endometriosis. This literature review aims to elaborate the findings
on psychological models used in endometriosis pain
described in qualitative and survey research, and to outline outstanding areas that need further investigation,
using a systematic method of synthesizing the findings of
qualitative studies [30].

Methods
This literature review was pre-registered (PROSPERO
CRD42022330527), and in preparation for the review,
the researchers discussed endometriosis and key literature with expert clinicians and experts by experience,
and consulted an academic librarian about the search
terms and databases to use. Reporting of the review is in
accordance with the ENTREQ statement [31] (see additional files Table 2).
Search strategy

On 6th May 2022, a comprehensive literature search of
all years of Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, PsycExtra, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, and LILACs was
conducted, aiming to include grey literature and international databases. Broad search terms on endometriosis,

Fig. 1 Search and selection of qualitative studies

Page 3 of 16

pelvic pain, quality of life and experience were employed,
and as they returned a large number of results, references
of studies retrieved were not further searched. The search
terms used are shown in additional files Table 1.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria were qualitative research or surveys, from peer reviewed journals or publicly available
PhD theses, whose participants were adult women (18
and over), not solely concerned with healthcare experience. There were no limitations placed on language or
date of publication. We excluded studies unrelated to
endometriosis, studies of non-human animals, literature
reviews, and conference abstracts.
Study selection

This search returned a large number of records, initially
screened using the Endnote X9.3.3 deduplication function, with further duplications removed by hand. Titles
were screened to remove theses below PhD Level and
irrelevant literature (e.g. male pelvic pain, cancer etc.).
The next stage of study selection (see Fig. 1) involved one
researcher (HM) screening titles and abstracts, removing those that were solely treatment comparisons, that
focused on chronic pelvic pain (CPP) with no reference to
endometriosis, or that focused exclusively on interactions
with healthcare professionals. Another researcher (AW)
checked a ~ 15% random sample (300) of the rejected
titles plus all 270 studies identified as possibly meeting
criteria; decisions were discussed and agreed. Full papers

de C Williams and McGrigor ﻿BMC Women’s Health

(2024) 24:50

were read for all possibly eligible studies, with further
removal of conference abstracts, papers with no reference to psychological models, accounts only of treatment
or healthcare experience, or chronic pelvic pain without
separate description of participants with endometriosis.
Quality assessment

The surveys and qualitative research were then analysed
and synthesized separately. For the qualitative research,
an amalgamation of the CASP and COREQ quality
assessment tools (Appendix A) was used to assess the
quality of the studies. The CASP and COREQ quality
assessment tools were both selected as appropriate after
trying several other tools on four studies. Duplicate questions on the two tools were removed, the combined version test run on four further studies, nonessential items
removed, and then the entire set split for rating, with an
overlap of four studies to check consistency. Lower quality studies were not removed, but the rating was kept
in mind during analysis. The researchers both assessed
four randomly selected studies, then compared findings.
Following this, they split the studies, and individually
assessed them.
Surveys: narrative analysis

For the surveys, data were extracted using narrative synthesis methods [32], suitable for thin data, on the population, sample size, location of study, questionnaire and
research tools used, the preoccupation/themes of the
survey questions and psychological models discussed.
Qualitative data synthesis

The data was synthesized according to Thomas and
Harden’s [30, 33] thematic synthesis method using inductive coding. This was chosen after reading around the
topic (particularly [33, 34]) and discussion with a colleague experienced in the fields of pain and of methods of
qualitative synthesis.
First, line by line codes were developed by the first
researcher (HM), and used on the Results and Discussion sections of all included papers, recording in NVivo
12 1.6.1. The resulting longlist contained 189 codes. The
second researcher (AW) applied these codes to 20% of
the sample primary studies, suggesting new ones where
necessary. The codes were discussed, agreed, and collapsed or combined. Descriptive themes, staying close to
the content of the primary studies, were then generated
from the grouped codes, separately by each researcher,
then discussed and agreed. Finally, analytic (interpretative) themes were developed jointly using the map of
descriptive themes and their constituent codes. Themes
were, where possible, given a title that used the words of
a participant from one of the primary studies.

Positionality and reflexivity

Given the subjective bias inherent in decisions described
above, and of interpretations, we include a statement of
position to make our perspectives more transparent.
AW is an academic and clinical psychologist, with over
35 years’ experience working in chronic pain, including chronic pelvic pain. While she has used the fear and
avoidance model in academic and clinical work, she considers it to capture only part of the chronic pain experience, even in musculoskeletal pain. HM is a research
assistant, with experience in qualitative research. This
was her first project researching pain, and considers the
biopsychosocial model to be the most convincing pain
model to date. Throughout the project, the researchers
aimed for reflexive processing of reviewed material, considering at each point whether and how their beliefs and
concerns might influence their decisions.

Results
Over 2000 records were screened on title and abstract,
and 109 selected as possibly eligible. These were read as
full papers. Despite help from libraries, and attempts to
contact authors, full texts for seven studies could not be
obtained. Two studies were discovered in the search as
theses, but authors directed us to their published studies, which were included. Three survey studies, all with
abstracts but not full text in English, appeared to be
unlikely to meet criteria so were excluded. Responses
were not forthcoming from two sets of authors. This
resulted in the synthesis of 22 surveys and 33 qualitative
texts, one of which was translated from Portuguese.
Surveys

The research literature that used surveys of women with
endometriosis (with or without a comparison population) to elicit information about physical and psychological health were predominantly concerned with quality of
life and what physical and psychological variables were
associated with it. This appeared to be an area of increasing interest: seven studies were published between 2016
and 2019, six studies each in 2020 and 2021, and three
in 2022 up to the point of the search. Six studies were
from Australia, four from the USA and Canada, one from
Brazil, one from South Africa, and the remainder from
Europe. All but one, on adolescents up to 25 years old,
recruited adults, usually defined as over 18 years, mainly
relying on self-diagnosis, with some self-report of medical diagnosis. All studies were cross-sectional, 12 studies
describing a single population, eight comparing women
with endometriosis with women without, and two making comparisons within a sample of women with endometriosis, one relating to psychological health and the
other to diet.

The most common focus of the studies was quality of
life and the gynecological, pain and psychological symptoms associated with it (nine studies), with two investigating sexual activity in relation to quality of life. Pain
and its relationship to lifestyle problems in endometriosis
was addressed by three studies; psychological problems,
depression in particular, were the focus of two studies
and stigma of one further study. Fatigue was investigated
in two studies; and diet and infertility in one each. One
study tested the performance of a generic psychological
questionnaire in an endometriosis population.
Pain (pelvic pain, abdominal pain, low back pain, menstrual pain, dyspareunia, and pain on defecation) was
investigated in relation to quality of life in 10 studies
[34–43], all of which found more pain to be associated
with poorer quality of life (often health-related quality of
life), greater impact of endometriosis on life, or poorer
psychological health. Two of these 11 [35, 39] reported
dyspareunia alone to be associated with poorer quality
of life. One further study [44] did not analyse pain separately from a broader physical function score which was
associated with poorer quality of life. Two other studies
on pain [45, 46] investigated characteristics of the pain
itself and reported evidence of central sensitization.
The association of endometriosis symptoms with psychological symptomatology was investigated in eight
studies [37, 42–44, 47–50], generally finding greater
distress (although Bien [34] did not) and an association
between greater distress, more or more severe endometriosis symptoms and particularly pain, and poorer
quality of life. Only one study [41] was explicit about the
psychological model used as a basis for the investigation,
describing the fear and avoidance model [51] and using
catastrophizing [52] as a central variable. They described
phenomena related to the fear and avoidance model in
terms of pain cognition: hypervigilance to pain, catastrophizing, and fear of pain, all of which they found to
be more extensive in women with endometriosis than in
healthy controls; avoidance of activity on the basis of fear
of pain was inferred, not sampled. Other papers in this
sample drew implicitly or explicitly on psychological distress as a common consequence of endometriosis, but for
at least one survey psychological distress was assumed
to be an antecedent [42]. (See additional files for surveys
not referenced here.)
Qualitative studies

The largest number of studies (11) was conducted in the
UK; Australia and the USA provided 5 each, with 3 from
Brazil, 2 each from Italy and Germany, and one each
from New Zealand, Iran, Puerto Rico, Spain, The Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary; and one sampled from France,
Germany, and the USA. They were published from 1995

Page 5 of 16

to 2022, the majority since 2018, with a range of participants from six to 61, a mean of 25 per study. Participants
were mainly recruited through advertisements in endometriosis groups and online message boards and social
media (19 studies), with 7 studies using patients identified/referred by medical professionals, 7 recruited from
outpatient clinics or hospitals, 5 using word of mouth/
snowballing alongside those listed above, 4 using a subset of a larger study, and 2 using a medical recruitment
company. For the three studies [53–55] that included
healthcare professionals in their sample, we used as far
as possible only material from women with endometriosis. Twenty-three of the 33 studies collected data
through individual interview, with a mix of face-to-face
and online settings; five used focus groups; three used a
written response, and two used combinations of these
methods. Participants were mainly in their thirties or
early forties, with a range of 12–78 years (23 studies provided data) and a mean of 35 years (from 21 studies). The
mean age at diagnosis was 27 years (8 studies), with a
mean diagnostic delay of 8.5 years (8 studies) and mean
age for onset of symptoms 17 years old (2 studies). Ethnic
diversity was purposively sampled in just one study [56];
where ethnicity was reported, there was a general lack of
diversity, but this was rarely commented on (one exception was Cole et al. [57]) (Table 1).
Quality assessment

Information collected using the combined COREQ/CASP
form is provided in full in Additional files, Table 4, and
summarized here. Interviewers identified themselves as
academics, students, psychologists or nurses, although
about half the studies provided no information, and few
described any training in interviewing. Twenty studies (see
Additional files Table 4) employed only female interviewers, one used both male and female, and one only male [59];
the remainder did not specify the sex of the interviewer/s.
Five researchers identified themselves in their publication as having endometriosis [57, 60, 61, 64, 67], but it is
not clear whether that information was shared with their
interviewees, making it hard to estimate how it might have
affected data. Two studies reflected on whether characteristics of the interviewer/s might have biased recruitment or
interview content, one [57] in relation to ethnicity, declaring interviewers to be white academics, and the other [81]
in terms of sociodemographic characteristics. Seven further studies included reflexive comments on the researchers, and six more a very limited statement; others provided
none, despite the convention of qualitative researchers
attempting to be transparent about possible biases brought
to their data.
Four studies described their methods only as qualitative; the remainder elaborated, either identifying a

method (such as discourse analysis, or thematic analysis)
or an epistemological stance, or both. The most common
aim was to describe women’s experience of living with
endometriosis (14 studies), including its social impact;
the next most common was studies of assessment tools
or trajectories of diagnosis and treatment (8 studies);
there were 7 studies of meaning and identity; two of language use; and one each of stigma and of fatigue.
Thematic synthesis

Coding of content of results and discussion, both directly
reported participant comments and those of the researchers, provided 188 initial codes, which were then grouped
and named as far as possible using quoted phrases from
the studies. Further grouping produced five themes concerned with the internal experience of having endometriosis; two themes about interface with the external world;
two concerned with effects on interpersonal and social
life, and one (in three parts) with encounters with medical
care (see Fig. 2).

Pain‑endometriosis affects every aspect of life This
theme addressed the impact of both endometriosis symptoms and pain on all areas of life, loss of identity, of freedom, and of imagined future. It shared several codes with
Emotional components and consequences of pain and
endometriosis. There was a minor positive component,
although this may have been elicited mainly by researchers’ questions about positive aspects.
Endometriosis pain is different The sense of difference
from normal menstrual pain was widely emphasized,
perhaps because so many women had historically had
their early symptoms dismissed as “just period pain”, and
perhaps because interviewers were almost always women
who would be expected to have experience of dysmenorrhea. Pain was described as qualitatively and quantitatively different, often in very powerful terms, and again
this shared several codes with Emotional components and
consequences of pain and endometriosis.
Endometriosis affects my body beyond pain This theme
particularly concerned unpredictable bleeding, in timing or quantity; effects on the bowel, bladder, appetite,
energy and sleep, and comorbidities; and discomfort with
sexual activity. Women described a relationship with
their bodies that had changed for the worse.
Emotional components and consequences of pain and
endometriosis Self-doubt, anxiety, depression, and a
general sense of being unable to function adequately were

Page 10 of 16

commonly reported, directly linked to the problems associated with endometriosis and pain. Occasionally this was
expressed with some positive sense of managing it: “yes,
it’s painful and yes, it’s awful, but you can live with it”.
Fears and worries about pain and endometriosis Because
of our particular research question, we did not subsume
this under the previous theme, although that would have
been possible. Fears and worries concerned infertility;
worsening and recurrence with or without treatment,
including the possibility of cancer developing; and concerns that daughters would also have endometriosis.
Codes were mainly shared with Pain-endometriosis affects
every aspect of life and Encounters with medical care.
Interface with the external world

Self‑regulation of pain and endometriosis This theme concerned the ways in which women managed their endometriosis in order to be able to live a more normal life, from
“hiding from the world”, to taking analgesics, planning carefully, and building understanding of their condition. In that
sense many contributions expressed some sense of achievement of controlling the impact of endometriosis.
Social regulation to manage pain and endometriosis This
theme expressed both the scepticism that others in participants’ lives could understand their difficulties, and also
help and support received from others in managing endometriosis and pain.
Effects on interpersonal and social life

Endometriosis and pain affect close others There was a
strong sense, despite self- and social regulation, that family
members were negatively affected by the woman’s endometriosis, and in particular, romantic and sexual partners.
Endometriosis and pain affect social life and work Related
to the foregoing theme, and to attempts at social regulation, were many accounts of either avoiding socialising at
specific times or in general, and of having to take time off
work or struggling to hide symptoms. There were a few
accounts of friends and of work colleagues and structures
being supportive.
Encounters with medical care

This was a large theme, perhaps partly as a function of
being the main research focus of several studies. It shared
few codes with other themes, and had three sub-themes.

Fig. 2 Main themes and sub-themes

The first described the overall sense of being unpleasantly
exposed by diagnostic and treatment procedures: “I think
they forget that you’re a person”. The second sub-theme
portrayed diagnosis, often many years after the onset of
symptoms, as a turning point. Although most accounts
described negative experiences of the struggle for validation and diagnosis, there was also a positive aspect when
this was achieved, as in, “I was devastated but relieved”.
The third sub-theme concerned disappointments with
treatment options and with limitations and disadvantages
to what was offered, from contraceptives to encouragement to have children as soon as possible, whatever the
woman’s situation. There were very few positive comments on achieving some control through treatment.
Psychological dimensions of endometriosis pain

The theme of Emotional components and consequences of
pain and endometriosis provided very familiar material
from other studies of chronic pain, musculoskeletal, visceral and pelvic, or mixed [1, 14, 15, 23, 85, 86]. Since we
are interested particularly in how well the psychological
experience of endometriosis pain fits the generic fear and
avoidance chronic pain model [86], we examine here in
more detail the content of the theme Fears and worries
about pain and endometriosis.
The commonest fears, from almost half the studies, concerned infertility. For younger women, this was anticipation of being unable to conceive or being unable to sustain
a pregnancy; for older women, infertility was for many (but
not all) a significant loss, or for those who had children, concerns about infertility had interwoven in problematic ways
both with their treatment options and with their life planning, and some expressed disappointment that parity had
not resolved either pain or endometriosis as they had been
led to expect. The next most common fear was of recurrence
(12 studies) of endometriosis, of worsening following unsuccessful treatment (11 studies) or without (7 studies), and
these were linked to extreme pain (“you’d think you were
dying”). This most closely resembled the overly negative

predictions and associated distress described in the fear and
avoidance model. Two other sources of fear occurred in a
handful of studies each: of cancer (the diagnosis having been
missed, or developing in future), and of genetic transmission
of endometriosis to daughters creating additional responsibilities for their mothers in trying to manage it effectively.
Not evident in these studies was women’s fear of damage to
their bodies during sexual activity, which unlike most other
activities that exacerbate pain (such as digestion, or defecation) can be avoided. Attempts at control for such activities
focus rather on the emotional or social aspects.

Discussion
Taking together the survey findings and the qualitative meta-synthesis, clear associations emerged between
endometriosis pain, distress, and reduced quality of life,
but not strongly with any definitive psychological formulation of pain and related problems, nor with the
predominant sense of threat that contributes to central
sensitization [14]. In the only survey study in which an
explicit psychological model was used [41], that of fear
and avoidance [86] and catastrophic thinking biases [52],
support was found for its application, although methodology was somewhat weak (comparison with pain-free
population, and avoidance not directly sampled). Several
surveys used outdated models of ‘somatization’, somatic
expression of psychological distress, that constitute an
unsatisfactory model of endometriosis. The qualitative
synthesis combined a relatively large number of studies;
they showed substantial common ground in the experiences of women with painful endometriosis, across continents, population samples, and research questions.
No previous review has combined women’s perspectives on the experience of endometriosis pain in such an
open-ended way. Our findings describe women’s sense of
being let down by and alienated from their bodies, at the
same time as needing to attend to and attempt to regulate,
or at least predict, their bodies’ vagaries, to function in the
outside world, on a daily level, and on a level of life plans.

de C Williams and McGrigor ﻿BMC Women’s Health

(2024) 24:50

This uses normal rather than psychopathological terms in
a coherent framework that combines findings of various
other reviews, and is entirely compatible with central sensitization maintaining pain whatever the level of disease [3].
A narrative synthesis of qualitative, quantitative, and
mixed method studies [1] described concerns of women
with endometriosis about fertility and planning and having children, medical management, information and support, emotional distress (although without any description
of anxieties), and feelings of powerlessness. A more recent
systematic review [27] of nine quantitative and qualitative studies reported few differences between women with
endometriosis pain and people with other chronic pains in
metacognitions, including ‘catastrophic thinking’, and coping strategies, noting that more emotion-focused coping
and avoidance was associated with poorer mental health.
Similar findings are reported in a recent review that distinguished ‘catastrophic thinking’ as the main predictor of
pain intensity from anxiety, depression and stress, associated with poorer quality of life [4]. A thematic synthesis by
Young et al. [26] noted the gaps in the study of emotional
and social wellbeing, and recent studies go some way
towards filling this gap [19]. Many reviews of endometriosis
note its deleterious effects on quality of life (e.g. [87]), and a
few link this directly to pain [16] and, therefore, to the need
for psychological support or treatment [88–90].
Limitations & strengths

Our search was broad and not limited to English language papers, although to those abstracted in English. Nevertheless, there are likely to be studies of
endometriosis and associated problems inaccessible to
our searches, narrowing the cultural range of studies, and
we did not screen references of eligible studies for any
missed by the search strategy. Two papers focused predominantly on fertility problems, from Iran and Brazil
[53, 83]. We focused only on the experience of women;
there is a substantial research literature on the experience
of their sexual partners which we excluded. We annotated the studies using a previously untried combination
of two established (and somewhat overlapping) scales;
this may have increased the arbitrariness of what is taken
as a marker of ‘quality’, and contributed to our decision
not to assign scores to annotations. We were interested
particularly in the extent to which researchers intentionally or unintentionally elicited particularly content in
interviews, but reporting of most studies, even the small
minority with a reflexive statement, did not comment on
this except in the case of a male interviewer [59, 78]. It is
hard to summarize quality other than with the narrative
provided. We did not double-code and double-rate studies, relying instead on doing so for a sample and proceeding with frequent discussion and consensus, but ideally

Page 12 of 16

a larger team would have worked on this review [91].
Finally, the survey data were hard to interpret given that
many respondents were self-diagnosed; we have therefore commented more on survey authors’ models than
on their outcomes, nor did we attempt any quantitative
analyses.
Clinical and research implications

Many studies recommended better education about
endometriosis for clinicians, emphasizing, in particular,
the role of nurses in providing information to patients.
We would hope that such education fully integrated the
problem of pain and involved all relevant healthcare professionals; our search returned many qualitative studies
of women’s experience with endometriosis where pelvic
pain was barely addressed, or was represented as one
symptom among many, disregarding the extent to which
pain itself is a significant cause of distress and difficulty
managing everyday life (see [12, 29]), requiring attention
and efforts to mitigate pain in its own right, not just secondarily to treatment of endometriosis.
There is a broader need for psychological care to be
better integrated into health services for many diagnosable conditions, including endometriosis. Although we
found some common ground for understanding psychological problems that can be extrapolated from chronic
pain in general, the focus on fear of physical damage and
avoidance of physical demands predominant in some
psychological interventions is not supported by our findings. Although it is too early in these explorations to suggest specific psychological interventions, information
and support, not least from other women with endometriosis and resources created and maintained by them,
may meet most needs, with skilled psychological intervention for those women who are more distressed and
limited by their pain. Discussion with a clinical specialist about attention to symptoms and when to seek expert
healthcare can support self-management in women concerned about recurrence of adhesions; discussion about
possible triggers and systematic ways to test them can be
helpful to those seeking greater control. Multimodal pain
management interventions based in psychological understanding are widely recommended for chronic pain of all
sorts (e.g. NICE [92]), but ideally is personalized to the
particular problems and priorities of the patient and recognition of specific concerns associated with the disease
or type of pain [3].
Several research gaps were noted by As-Sanie et al.
[93] at a US meeting of clinicians of various disciplines,
women with endometriosis, researchers, and members
from industry and government. Among them were the
need for mental health professionals attached to endometriosis clinics; the contribution of physiotherapists

de C Williams and McGrigor ﻿BMC Women’s Health

(2024) 24:50

and others to pain-relieving strategies; the lack of accurate information on relief from different types of hysterectomy, and on pain recurrence following surgery. A
priority setting partnership in the UK included in the top
10 priorities, alongside better and less invasive diagnosis
and improved education of healthcare professionals, the
need to determine the most effective ways of managing
the emotional and psychological impact of living with
endometriosis [94]. Both effective management and the
more routine involvement of mental health professionals
proposed by As-Sanie and colleagues [93] require a better
understanding of the content of women’s distress about
endometriosis, and the particular areas of impact; this
review provides a step towards that understanding. There
seems little need for repetition of descriptive studies of
the impact of endometriosis on women’s lives, given the
number and breadth we found. We would recommend
investigations with clearer theoretical roots in psychology, particularly but not exclusively the psychology of
pain, to establish a solid basis for developing effective
psychological interventions, with more of a focus than is
characteristic of psychological models to issues of social
disclosure, difficulties in social situations, and stigma,
affecting both work and personal social situations.

Conclusion
Endometriosis has widespread impact on women: on
their relationship with their bodies; their psychological
and social wellbeing; and on life plans and lifestyle. This
is similar to the situation of people with other chronic
pains, musculoskeletal, neuropathic, or visceral. However, the dominant psychological model of pain, of fear
of reinjury and increased pain from avoidable activity, resulting in disability, only partly fits the situation of
women with endometriosis. Many factors that exacerbate pain cannot be avoided, nor is there evidence of an
overarching fear of physical demands (of everyday life or
valued activities) threatening bodily integrity. The psychological component of endometriosis pain requires
further exploration with the aim of building psychological models that can underpin targeted interventions for
distress and social withdrawal.
