ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

The management of endometriosis has been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed
to introduce the establishment and application of a new follow-up method during the COVID19 pandemic—the electronic follow-up (e-follow-up) platform for endometriosis—and to test
the applicability of the platform-based follow-up management model and patient satisfaction.
We used the platform for information entry and post-operative follow-up of 152 patients with
endometriosis from January 2021 to August 2022, and compared patients’ Zung’s Self-Rating
Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), and Visual Analogue Score (VAS) (range:
0 10, indicating: no pain-extreme pain) scores preoperatively and after 6-month of follow-up,
together with recording patients’ follow-up satisfaction and number of recurrence of lesions.
Eventually, the SDS, SAS, and VAS scores were significantly lower than those at pre-surgery
(p < .001), and the follow-up satisfaction rate reached 100%, with 91.41% expressing great satis­
faction. The cumulative number of recurrences was 2 out of 138. Follow-up using this platform
reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission, enabled more efficient access to healthcare resources
for patients with endometriosis, improved the efficiency of follow-up management, met the
mental health needs of the patients.

Introduction
Endometriosis is defined as the growth of endometrial
glands and stroma in different locations outside the
uterine cavity [1], which affects about 10% of women
in
their
reproductive
years
worldwide
[2].
Endometriosis usually presents with chronic pelvic
pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dysuria, fatigue,
infertility [1], and an increased risk of depression and
anxiety [3,4]. These symptoms place a significant bur­
den on their physical and mental health, quality of
life, economic situation, and healthcare systems [3,5].
Therapy for endometriosis can consist of medica­
tion and/or surgery, depending on (1) whether the
patient is not amenable to medication, (2) in the pres­
ence of deep endometriosis, (3) in combination with
other diseases requiring surgery, and (4) with intoler­
able pelvic pain or (5) infertility [6]. Even after surgery,

long-term hormonal suppression is advised owing to
the high rates of postoperative recurrence [7].
Currently, a definitive cure for endometriosis is lacking;
therefore, the disease requires long-term individual­
ized treatment and follow-up management. This
greatly increases the frequency of patients’ medical
visits and allied health consultations.
Restrictions and social isolation measures caused by
COVID-19 and difficulties in accessing medical resour­
ces made the management of endometriosis even
more difficult [8]. In order to centralize the long-term
management of post-operative patients with endo­
metriosis, we collaborated with Zero Krypton
Technology (Beijing) Ltd. to build the “Electronic
Follow-up Platform for Endometriosis.” The purpose of
this manuscript is to describe the electronic platform
and report on patient satisfaction with the platform.

Materials and methods
Overall, 152 patients with endometriosis were recruited
at Qilu Hospital from January 2021 to August 2022. The
inclusion criteria involved: consent to postoperative
long-term hormonal medication and surgically and his­
tologically confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis.
Exclusion criteria included the presence of contraindica­
tions to hormonal drugs such as GnRH-a and combined
oral contraceptives; psychiatric disorders limiting
patient cooperation; or malignant tumors.

Establishment of the platform and formulation of
follow-up work
The platform was developed by our professional endo­
metriosis medical team in collaboration with Zero
Krypton Technology (Beijing) Ltd., which includes a
data collection port, a back-end input port, and a
cloud service storage port. Twenty-four baseline
period sections were built using the endometriosis dis­
ease characteristics and treatment protocols, which
included demographics, menstrual reproductive his­
tory, imaging reports, CA-125 and other hematological
indicators, surgical records, and first postoperative
medication regimen and time (Figure 1). Forty-eight
follow-up period sections were built using endometri­
osis prognosis information, like medication records,
VAS score for pain symptoms similar to preoperative,
ultrasound, and other examinations to record patient
follow-up results at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postopera­
tively (Figure 2). The follow-up management team
included a chief physician, an attending physician, sev­
eral follow-up managers, and platform interfacing staff.
Moreover, we had also established a WeChat followup management group to facilitate communication
among patients about their conditions, meanwhile, we
interacted one-on-one with patients during the followup by adding their personal WeChat. The VAS score
was used to assess the degree of the most pro­
nounced pain symptom during menstruation or, for
non-cyclic pelvic pain, the degree during the men­
strual cycle when the pelvic pain symptom was most
severe. In addition, patients’ psychological depression
and anxiety levels were assessed by SDS [9] and SAS
[10] questionnaires which are widely used and provide
self-report measures of depression and anxiety
because of good reliability, validity, and internal con­
sistency [11,12].
Tasks during the follow-up period which were
entirely undertaken by follow-up managers include: (i)
regularly reminded patients of their post-operative
hormone medication and review at the nearest

hospital through online follow-up, helped to inspect
the examination reports and promptly reminded them
to see the competent doctor for evaluation if a relapse
was suspected, such as a postoperative recurrence of
pain of similar magnitude to preoperative, or recur­
rence of lesions suggested by ultrasound; (ii) explained
the type, dosage and adverse reactions of the medica­
tion, emphasized the need for long-term medication
for endometriosis, instructed them to use medications
(e.g. “add-back” therapy) when they had adverse reac­
tions, provided pregnancy preparation guidance to
patients with fertility requirements, e.g. three times of
GnRH-a treatments were recommended if the myome­
trium was undamaged during surgery; otherwise six
times of GnRH-a treatments followed by oral hormonal
medication, with the duration of treatment increasing
with the degree of myometrial damage; ovulation
monitoring during pregnancy preparation; (iii) pro­
vided with psychological counseling to alleviate
patients’ own adverse emotions or those caused by
adverse drug reactions, etc., and encouraged them to
establish good habits and reevaluated SDS, SAS, and
VAS scores after 6-month of follow-up; (iv) recorded
patients’ scores on their satisfaction with the followup management after 6-month of follow-up (tele­
phone question: what’s your satisfaction with the for­
mat and content of the reminders and communication
during our follow-up management, with a total score
of 100, very satisfied: >90; basic satisfied: 60–90;
unsatisfied: <60) and the necessity scores of platform
existence (the total score is 3, very necessary: 3; aver­
age effect: 2; not necessary: 1). See the flow chart
(Figure 3) for details on the application of the platform
and the follow-up process.
Patients who registered for a follow-up review
would automatically generate the next review
appointment. Follow-up managers logged onto the
platform bi-weekly to upload patients’ preoperative
information, review results, and medication dates and
regimens through the data collection terminal. The
back-end input port collected patients’ electronic
medical records during hospitalization and reviews, AI
technology was used to identify optically captured
medical records, combined with the central entry sys­
tem to extract and structure medical data accurately,
and finally uploaded to the cloud service storage port,
seamlessly linking follow-up data with treatment data.

Main observation indicators
As of August 31, 2022, limited by the short follow-up
time, we set the observation endpoints as after

Results
As of August 31, 2022, a total of 14 out of 152
patients were lost to follow-up, with the lost to fol­
low-up rate at 9.2% (<10.0%). Currently, a total of 138

patients have been included in the platform of which
128 patients completed 6-month follow-up. Among
them, 112 cases of intra-pelvic endometriosis (periton­
eal endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis, and deep
endometriosis) and 26 cases of extra-pelvic endometri­
osis, including 20 cases of abdominal wall endometri­
osis and 6 cases of perineal endometriosis, were
noted.
The patients’ ages ranged from 15 to 49 years, with
a mean age of 34.27 (6.52) years. Of the patients,

The VAS was assessed as the most prominent pain symptoms at the time of diagnosis.

97.8% reported discomfort, and 10.9% reported noncyclic chronic pelvic pain. The average VAS score was
5.00 (5.00), and 48.6% of patients needed painkillers.
In patients with intra-pelvic endometriosis, 88.4% had
�3 clinical symptoms of which dysmenorrhea, fatigue,
and changes in bowel habits (constipation or diarrhea)
were more frequently reported, and dyschezia was
seen in some patients with deep endometriosis.
Patients with the abdominal wall and perineal

endometriosis all presented with tender masses on
the body surface. Patient characteristics at baseline are
reported in Table 1.

SDS and SAS scores
Fifty-nine of the 128 patients who had completed the
6-month follow-up showed depressive symptoms pre­
operatively, of which 29 were mild, 23 were moderate

JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

and 7 were severe; 30 patients showed anxiety symp­
toms, of which 22 were mild, 1 was moderate and 6
were severe. The mean SDS score preoperative and
after 6-month of follow-up were 47.50 (23.75) and
30.63 (12.50) respectively; the mean SAS score pre­
operative and after 6-month of follow-up were 40.00
(14.69) and 27.00 (6.25) respectively. There was a sig­
nificant decrease in both SDS (p<.001) and SAS
(p<.001) scores (Figure 4).

Scores of patient satisfaction and necessity of
platform
The follow-up satisfaction rate reached 100.0%, of
which 91.4% patients were very satisfied. 87.5% of
patients said the platform was very essential for their
post-operative treatment, while 12.5% said the effect­
iveness were fair.

Improvement in clinical symptoms
The mean VAS score was significantly decreased to
0.00(2.00) after 6-month of follow-up compared to
preoperative (p<.001) (Figure 4).

Postoperative recurrence
As of August 31, 2022, the cumulative number of
recurrences was 2 out of 138.

Endometriosis is a common estrogen-dependent,
chronic, neuro-inflammatory gynecological disorder
with a heterogeneous and complex presentation.
Symptoms of endometriosis include several signature
yet nonspecific types of pain, an increased risk of
infertility, and widespread fatigue, and even lead to an
elevated risk of developing emotional distress, espe­
cially depression and anxiety disorders [3,4].
Although surgical treatment can help relieve clinical
symptoms, restore anatomy, and improve fertility out­
comes [13], more than half of the patients had persist­
ent pain or even a second surgery within 5 years after
surgery [14,15], and postoperative recurrence rate
increases with longer follow-up [16]. It is crucial to
improve postoperative hormonal medication to shrink
and degenerate residual lesions and reduce the recur­
rence of dysmenorrhea symptoms [7].
Given the particularities of endometriosis, it is rec­
ommended that clinicians implement long-term stand­
ardized follow-up management. Patient-centered care
could lead to better health-related outcomes [17].
Additionally, some psychological studies of endometri­
osis have found a positive correlation between coping
styles and improvement of depression and anxiety
symptoms [18]. This suggests that positive psycho­
logical interventions [19] are applicable in the treat­
ment and follow-up management of patients with
endometriosis.
The COVID-19 pandemic had resulted in restrictions
and social segregation, challenging the management
of endometriosis worldwide. A study conducted in

8

Turkey showed that 83.9% of endometriosis patients
were worried about suffering endometriosis-related
problems during the pandemic, and 53.63% believed
their treatment was affected [8]. Virtual care seems to
be a good alternative for endometriosis patients in cir­
cumstances where physical consultations are not pos­
sible during the outbreak [20].
According to our results, surgery combined with
medication for endometriosis can significantly improve
patients’ clinical symptoms. Platform-based electronic
follow-up management made the management of
endometriosis during the epidemic more convenient
and efficient, optimized the allocation of medical
resources, reduced patient mobility and the risk of
COVID-19 transmission. Through regular communica­
tion with patients, timely reminding for medication,
and review and answering to questions and concerns
about treatment could help build confidence in the
treatment and reduce the rate of self-retreat caused
by lack of awareness and side effects. Meantime,
patients had reduced levels of depression and anxiety.
By advising on medication and ovulation monitoring
during pregnancy preparation, we helped patients find
the best time to conceive. Moreover, we have
achieved better patient satisfaction compared to plat­
form-independent routine care [21].
This study doesn’t reflect the platform’s manage­
ment of patients who refused hormonal medication
postoperatively. Additionally, unavoidable surgical
stress might have led to elevated preoperative SAS
scores. It was difficult to clarify whether changes in
SDS and SAS scores were entirely attributable to plat­
form management with surgery and the lack of a plat­
form-independent control group. Increasing patient
sample size through multi-center recruitment, extend­
ing the follow-up period, and setting clear observa­
tional endpoints can better investigate postoperative
recurrence and pregnancy and improve the credibility
of the study.

Conclusions
The e-follow-up platform for endometriosis helped
overcome time and space constraints, enabled more
efficient access to healthcare resources for patients,
greatly mitigated the impact of the pandemic on med­
ical work, enhanced the efficiency of follow-up man­
agement, reduced patient anxiety and depression, and
received excellent patient feedback. The establishment
of a rich database is expected to improve the effi­
ciency of scientific research.
