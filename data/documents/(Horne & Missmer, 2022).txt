Endometriosis affects approximately 190 million women and people assigned
female at birth worldwide. It is a chronic, inflammatory, gynecologic disease marked
by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, which in many patients
is associated with debilitating painful symptoms. Patients with endometriosis are
also at greater risk of infertility, emergence of fatigue, multisite pain, and other
comorbidities. Thus, endometriosis is best understood as a condition with variable
presentation and effects at multiple life stages. A long diagnostic delay after
symptom onset is common, and persistence and recurrence of symptoms despite
treatment is common. This review discusses the potential genetic, hormonal, and
immunologic factors that lead to endometriosis, with a focus on current diagnostic
and management strategies for gynecologists, general practitioners, and clinicians
specializing in conditions for which patients with endometriosis are at higher risk.
It examines evidence supporting the different surgical, pharmacologic, and nonpharmacologic approaches to treating patients with endometriosis and presents an
easy to adopt step-by-step management strategy. As endometriosis is a multisystem
disease, patients with the condition should ideally be offered a personalized,
multimodal, interdisciplinary treatment approach. A priority for future discovery is
determining clinically informative sub-classifications of endometriosis that predict
prognosis and enhance treatment prioritization.
Introduction
Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory,
gynecologic disease marked by the presence of
endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, which
affects approximately 10% of women during
their reproductive years—190 million women
worldwide.1 In many patients, it is associated
with chronic painful symptoms and other
comorbidities, including infertility.2 The health
burden of endometriosis includes chronic pain and
significant lifetime costs of $27 855 per year per
patient,3 accumulating to annual healthcare costs
for endometriosis of approximately $22bn in the US
alone and £12.5bn in the UK in treatment, work loss,
and healthcare costs.4 Although more than 50% of
adults diagnosed as having endometriosis report
onset of severe pelvic pain during adolescence,5
most young women with endometriosis do not
receive timely treatment. Almost 60% of women
will see three or more clinicians before a diagnosis
of endometriosis is made after an average of seven
years with symptoms.6 Women with endometriosis
lose on average 11 hours of work per week, similar
to other chronic conditions including type 2
diabetes, Crohn’s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.7

Adolescents are at risk of having inadequately
remediated symptoms during prime years for
social development and life planning,8 and women
must be resilient against inadequately remediated
symptoms and emerging comorbidities. Women,
healthcare providers, and scientists would benefit
from conceptualizing endometriosis as a condition
that can affect the whole woman. This includes
a better understanding of the risk of subsequent
development of autoimmune disease, cancer, and
cardiovascular disease and a whole health approach
to monitoring and wellbeing.9
This review is aimed at general practitioners
and pediatric specialists who are most likely to
interact with patients as signs and symptoms of
endometriosis first emerge and from whom early
attention and empiric treatment may dramatically
shorten the burden; gynecology specialists for whom
myths must be dispelled and who must be aware of
state of the art knowledge about patient centered
treatments; endometriosis specialists who care
for women’s endometriosis associated symptoms
across the life course; and clinical researchers
and scientists who must be inspired to bring their
expertise and creativity to answer the fundamental

Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of
endometriosis

State of the Art REVIEW

Sources and selection criteria
We searched PubMed for studies using the term
“endometriosis.” We considered all peer reviewed
studies published in the English language between
1 January 2010 and 28 February 2022. We also
identified references from international guidelines
on endometriosis published during this time period.
We selected relevant publications outside this
timeline on the basis of review of the bibliography.
We predefined the priority of study selection for this
review according to the level of the evidence (metaanalyses, systematic or scoping reviews, randomized
controlled trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies,
case-control studies, cross sectional studies; a priori
exclusion of case series and case reports), by sample
size (we prioritized studies with larger sample size
as well as studies providing precision statistics), by
population sampling (we prioritized studies with
more diverse populations or with declared subpopulation design over narrow population samples),
and publication date (we prioritized more recent
studies).
Overall quality of evidence
Much of the knowledge on endometriosis is based
on concepts in early stages of evidence development
or on sparse literature. Many studies include single
hospital or clinic population samples with small total
sample sizes and disproportionately representing
patients presenting with infertility compared with
endometriosis associated pain.10
Beyond the limitations of the existing literature,
fundamental problems with the diagnosis of
endometriosis must be overcome before we can
adequately define endometriosis, its prevalence,
biologically and clinically informative subphenotypes, and its response to treatment and
long term prognosis.11 The lack of a non-invasive
diagnostic modality creates insurmountable
diagnostic biases driven by characteristics of those
patients who can and those who cannot access a
definitive surgical or imaging diagnosis and at what
point in their endometriosis journey the condition is
diagnosed.
Ovarian endometrioma or deep endometriosis
can be diagnosed through imaging if the patient
is geographically, economically, and socially
able to achieve referral to and evaluation from an
experienced imaging specialist.12 13 For women with
superficial peritoneal disease, definitive diagnosis
by means of surgical evaluation is limited to those
with symptoms deemed sufficiently severe and life
affecting and resistant to empiric treatment to justify
the inherent risks of surgery. Even among patients
with symptoms deemed to have enough of an effect
2

to warrant referral for a surgical evaluation, stigma,14
disbelief and misperceptions of pain or fertility that
can be driven by racism or elitism,15 and geographic
and economic barriers to accessing endometriosis
focused surgeons remain.
Beyond access to an appropriate, skilled
physician, the wide range of symptoms associated
with endometriosis—many of which are stigmatized
or normalized14 16—reduces the likelihood of
referral and increases time to referral to appropriate
specialists.5 6 11 17 The bias in diagnosis itself may be
influenced by variations in clinical symptoms among
different populations not adequately captured or
appreciated by standard clinical definitions or may
represent implicit bias in healthcare, leading to
an alternate interpretation of the same symptoms
affecting the likelihood of diagnosis. This delay
to diagnosis affects patients directly, but it also
results in most scientific studies capturing patients’
characteristics, biologic samples, and biomarker
measurements far into the natural pathophysiologic
progression of the disease. Moreover, studies from
African and Asian countries are considerably underrepresented compared with European and North
American countries.10 High quality studies from
these regions and development of a sensitive noninvasive diagnostic tool might alter existing global
prevalence and incidence estimates and may reveal a
more comprehensive view of what early milieu, signs
and symptoms, and long term health outcomes are
truly attributable to endometriosis.
Definition, symptoms, and classification
Among women with the condition, endometriosis has
a highly heterogeneous presentation of visualized
endometriotic lesions, multisystem symptom
presentation, and comorbid conditions (fig 1).
Surgically visualized macro sub-phenotypes of
endometriosis
Endometriosis is defined by the presence of
endometrium-like epithelium and/or stroma
(lesions) outside the endometrium and myometrium,
usually with an associated inflammatory process.18
Most endometriosis is found within the abdominal
cavity, and it exists as three subtypes: superficial
peritoneal endometriosis (accounting for around
80% of endometriosis), ovarian endometriosis (cysts
or “endometrioma”), and deep endometriosis1 19 (box
1; fig 2). All forms of endometriosis can be found
together, not solely as separate entities. Although
not a subtype, endometriosis situated inside the
bowel wall is termed “bowel endometriosis.” It
mostly affects the rectosigmoid area, but lesions can
also be found in other parts of the gastrointestinal
system, including the appendix. Endometriosis
involving the detrusor muscle and/or the bladder
epithelium is termed “bladder endometriosis.” Extraabdominal (replacing the older term “extra-pelvic”)
endometriosis is used to describe any endometriosis
lesions found outside of the abdomen (for example,
thoracic endometriosis).20 Iatrogenic endometriosis

enigmas of endometriosis etiology, informative subphenotyping, and novel patient centered treatment.
In this review, we use the terms “woman” and
“women.” However, it is important to note that
endometriosis can affect all people assigned female
at birth.

classification system.24 25 Evidence is emerging of
tissue injury and repair mechanisms mediated by
estradiol and inflammation.25 26
Endometriosis associated symptoms
Endometriosis is often associated with a range
of painful symptoms that include chronic pelvic
pain (cyclical and non-cyclical), painful periods
(dysmenorrhea), painful sex (dyspareunia), and
pain on defecation (dyschezia) and urination
(dysuria).1 27 Their severity can range from mild to
debilitating. Some women have no symptoms, others
have episodic pelvic pain, and still others experience
constant pain in multiple body regions.28 A related
observation is that some women transition between
these categories, progressing from episodic and
localized pain to that which is chronic, complex,
and more difficult to treat. Furthermore, women
with disease that is anatomically “severe” can have
minimal symptoms and women with “minimal”
evidence of endometriosis can have severe, life
affecting symptoms.1 19 In common with other
chronic pain conditions, women with endometriosis
often report experiencing fatigue and depression.
Infertility is significantly more common in patients
with endometriosis, with a doubling of risk compared
with women without endometriosis.2 Endometriosis
is discovered in 30-50% of women who present for
assisted reproductive treatment.29 30
Endometriosis associated or high risk comorbidities
Endometriosis is certainly a multisystem condition,
perhaps as a result of common pathogenesis or as
a consequence of the chronic endogenous response
to the presence of endometriotic lesions.9 Although
pelvic pain is the most common symptom of
possible endometriosis, women with endometriosis
also have a high risk of co-occurring or evolving
multisite pain.28 Patients with endometriosis
have a higher risk of presentation with comorbid
chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia,31-33
migraines,34 35 and also rheumatoid arthritis,33 36
psoriatic arthritis,37 and osteoarthritis.36 38 Reports
of back, bladder, or bowel pain are prevalent,16 39
with dyschezia being potentially predictive of
endometriosis.40 Nearly 50% of women with
bladder pain syndrome or interstitial cystitis have
endometriosis.41 42 Irritable bowel syndrome is a
common co-occurring diagnosis that reinforces the
importance of awareness of endometriosis among
gastroenterologists.43-45 These conditions may share
a common cause,46 they may arise together owing
to shared environmental or genetic factors, and/or
the occurrence of comorbid pain conditions could
be due to changes in pain perception after repeated
sensitization.47 Research focused on disentangling
the overlapping and independent pathways of these
frequently co-occurring pain associated conditions is
essential.48 49
Women with endometriosis have a greater
risk of presenting with other non-malignant
gynecologic diseases, including uterine fibroids

and adenomyosis.50 51 They are also at greater
risk of a subsequent diagnosis of malignancies,
autoimmune diseases, early natural menopause,
and
cerebrovascular
and
cardiovascular
conditions.36 52-57 The hypothesized causal
mechanisms for endometriosis discussed below
are all thought to be enhanced by and/or result
in chronic inflammation. Local and systemic
chronic inflammation can directly activate
afferent nociceptive fibers and promote pelvic
pain,58 although this does not entirely explain
the heterogeneity in types and severity of painful
symptoms that patients experience. Furthermore,
endometriosis induced chronic inflammation and
immune dysregulation may also contribute to the
endometriosis associated subsequent risk of each of
these comorbid conditions.59 60
Although this multisystem effect reinforces
the importance of knowledge of and attention
to endometriosis from general practitioners and
a myriad specialists for whole healthcare, the
most prominent association, and the focus of the
greatest volume of comorbidity research, is the
elevated risk of ovarian cancer among women with
endometriosis. A recent meta-analysis confirmed
this association,53 finding a nearly twofold greater
relative risk of ovarian cancer among patients with
endometriosis (summary relative risk (SRR) 1.93,
95% confidence interval 1.68 to 2.22; n=24 studies)
that was strongest for clear cell (3.44, 2.82 to 4.42;
n=5 studies) and endometrioid (2.33, 1.82 to 2.98;
n=5 studies) histotypes. However, among these
24 studies, significant evidence existed of both
4

heterogeneity across studies and publication bias
(Egger’s and Begg’s P values <0.01). Clinicians need
to reinforce that ovarian cancer is rare regardless
of women’s endometriosis status61: the absolute
lifetime risk in the general population is 1.3%,62
and applying the risk estimate from the metaanalysis (SRR 1.9) gives an absolute lifetime risk for
women with endometriosis of 2.5%, which is 1.2%
higher than the absolute risk for women without
endometriosis and still very low.
We should also recognize that coexisting
gynecologic conditions such as adenomyosis
and uterine fibroids,50 as well as associations
with endometrial cancer,53 can be influenced by
diagnostic biases and failure to distinguish between
diagnoses in women undergoing hysterectomy
and those in women with an intact uterus.11 51
When attempting to infer a causal relation between
endometriosis and other conditions, applying
rigorous prospective temporality (rather than cross
sectional co-occurrence) is particularly important for
valid subsequent risk associations.53 These studies
need large study populations with well documented
longitudinal data. A large impediment is the lack
of routine, harmonized documentation of the
characteristics of endometriosis and its absence from
international classification of diseases coding.63 64
Endometriosis classification systems
Several classification, staging, and reporting systems
have been developed; 22 systems were published
between 1973 and 2021.65 The three most commonly
used systems are the revised American Society

(stages I-IV; where stage I is equivalent to “minimal”
disease and stage 4 to “severe” disease), the
ENZIAN (and newer #ENZIAN) classification, and
the Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI).66-69 Many
validation studies and reports on the implementation
of the different systems have been published. The
rASRM system (scored at surgery on the basis
of the extent of visualized superficial peritoneal
lesions, endometriomas, and adhesions) has been
shown to have poor correlation with pain,70 fertility
outcomes, and prognosis, and the ENZIAN system
(which additionally includes deep endometriosis)
has been shown to have poor correlation with
symptoms and infertility.71-73 The EFI is a well
validated clinical tool that predicts pregnancy rates
after surgical staging of endometriosis, with ongoing
evaluation to determine the predictive importance
of the individual parameters included in the scoring
algorithm as well as the effect of completeness
the bmj | BMJ 2022;379:e070750 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2022-070750

of surgical treatment on pregnancy prediction.74
Unfortunately, no international agreement exists on
how to describe endometriosis or how to classify it.
As most systems show no, or very little, correlation
with patients’ symptoms and outcomes, this is
further evidence of our lack of understanding of the
physiology underlying the symptoms associated with
endometriosis.
Epidemiology
The exact prevalence of endometriosis is unknown
given diagnostic delays and barriers, and—perhaps
consequently—it is extremely varied depending on
the population and the indication for evaluation. A
recent meta-analysis identified 69 studies describing
the prevalence and/or incidence of endometriosis,
among which 26 studies were general population
samples, 17 were from regional/national hospitals
or insurance claims systems, and the remaining 43
studies were conducted in single clinic or hospital

settings.10 The prevalence reported in general
population studies ranged from 0.7% to 8.6%,
whereas that reported in single clinic or hospital
based studies ranged from 0.2% to 71.4%.
When defined by indications for diagnosis, the
prevalence of endometriosis ranged from 15.4%
to 71.4% among women with chronic pelvic pain,
from 9.0% to 68.0% among women presenting
with infertility, and from 3.7% to 43.3% among
women undergoing tubal sterilization. Few studies
have investigated the incidence and prevalence
of endometriosis specifically among adolescents.
The reported prevalence of visually confirmed
endometriosis among adolescents with pelvic pain
ranges from 25% to 100%, with an average of
49% among adolescents with chronic pelvic pain
and 75% among those unresponsive to medical
treatment.75 The Ghiasi meta-analysis reported a
decrease in recorded prevalence across the past 30
years.10 Speculating, this may be due to more rapid
and more ubiquitous embracing of empiric treatment
of symptom, forgoing or delaying definitive imaging
or surgical diagnosis, a patient centered approach
that has been ratified by the most recent European
endometriosis guideline.13 This hypothesis is
supported by a recent report from a large US health
system’s electronic medical records database that
observed a decline from 2006 through 2015 in
incidence rates for endometriosis (from 30.2 per
10 000 person years in 2006 to 17.4 per 10 000 person
years in 2015) but an increase in documentation of
chronic pelvic pain diagnoses (from 3.0% to 5.6%).76
Pathophysiology
Heritability and genetics
Estimates from twin studies suggest 47-51% total
heritability of endometriosis, with 26% estimated to
be from genetic variation.77-79 To date, nine genomewide association studies have been reported.59
The largest study so far, using 17 045 cases and
191 596 controls, has identified 19 single nucleotide
6

polymorphisms, most of which were more strongly
associated with rASRM stage III/IV, rather than stage
I/II, explaining 1.75% of risk for endometriosis.80
Consistent with other complex diseases with
multifactorial origins, no high penetrance
susceptibility genes for endometriosis have yet been
identified.62 The loci discovered to date are almost all
located in intergenic regions that are known to play
a role in the regulation of expression of target genes
yet to be identified. The critical next steps in genetic
discovery are to identify additional genes that reveal
novel pathophysiological pathways and also emerge
to better define the underpinnings of variation in
symptoms (in particular, pain types and infertility
and treatment response predictors) and also gene
expression correlated with comorbid autoimmune,
cancer, and cardiovascular conditions.62
Etiology
Reflux of endometrial tissue fragments/cells and
protein rich fluid through the fallopian tubes into
the pelvis during menstruation is considered the
most likely explanation for why endometriotic
lesions form within the peritoneal cavity, although
this mechanism is not sufficient as nearly all women
experience retrograde menstruation.81 82 Additional
postulated origins include celomic metaplasia and
lymphatic and vascular metastasis. Scientific avenues
exploring contributions of interacting endocrine,
immunologic, proinflammatory, and proangiogenic
processes are drawing curiosity and expertise
from varied disciplines with application of state of
the art technologies.59 Retrograde menstruation
of stem cells contributes to the establishment of
endometriosis,83 whereas bone marrow stem cells
contribute to the continued growth of endometriosis
lesions.84 85 Bone marrow derived stem cells may be
responsible for those cases of endometriosis outside
of the abdominal cavity.86
Studies exploring why lesions develop in some,
but not all, women have detected changes in the

SUSPECTED ENDOMETRIOSIS

State of the Art REVIEW

Mechanisms of endometriosis associated pain
The development of a new blood supply and
associated nerves (neuroangiogenesis) is considered
key to the establishment of endometriotic lesions
and the activation of peripheral pain pathways
(fig 3).92 Sensory C, sensory Ad, cholinergic, and
adrenergic nerve fibers have all been detected in
lesions. Estrogens can promote crosstalk between
immune cells and nerves within lesions, increasing
expression of nociceptive ion channels such as the
transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily
V member 1.93 Factors that promote inflammation
and nerve growth, such as nerve growth factor, tumor
necrosis factor α, and interleukin 1-β, are increased
in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis
and may exacerbate a neuroinflammatory cascade.
Consistent with other conditions associated with
chronic pain, endometriosis is associated with
unique, and sometimes disease specific, alterations
in the peripheral and central nervous systems,
including changes in the volume of regions of the
brain and in brain biochemistry.94 Increased risk
of central sensitization may partially explain why
approximately 30% of patients with endometriosis
will develop chronic pelvic pain that is unresponsive
to conventional treatments, including surgery.95
Through this central process, patients can experience
reduced pain thresholds, increased responsiveness
and length of aftereffects to noxious stimuli, and
expansion of the receptive field so that input from
non-injured tissue may elicit pain.46 47 Among
endometriosis patients with central sensitization,
the removal of the endometriotic lesions is unlikely
to result in adequate pain remediation owing
to continued activation of the central nervous
system.96 97 Thus, endometriosis associated pain does
not neatly fall into one of the three main categories
of chronic pain (that is, nociceptive, neuropathic,
or nociplastic),98-100 and it likely has a mixed pain
phenotype or sits somewhere along a continuum of
8

these pain phenotypes. For example, some patients
have primarily nociceptive or neuropathic pain,
others have primarily nociplastic pain, and the rest
have a mixed phenotype with variable contributions
of nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic pain.
Mechanisms of endometriosis associated infertility
Endometriosis may impair fertility through multiple
pathways, including peritoneal inflammation
and endocrine derangements, which interfere
with the follicular environment and consequently
affect ovarian function and ultimately reduce
oocyte competence.101 Several studies of women
undergoing in vitro fertilization have documented
lower oocyte yield or ovarian reserve among women
with endometriosis compared with those with other
infertility diagnoses.102 103 A recent study observed
lower oocyte yield among endometrioma affected
ovaries but not among the contralateral ovaries
that were unaffected by endometriosis compared
with unexposed ovaries from women with no
evidence of endometriosis.104 In addition, although
unproven, anatomical distortion and adhesions
caused by endometriosis, particularly in stage III-IV
disease, seem likely to reduce the chance of natural
conception.
Prevention
No way to prevent endometriosis is known.
Enhanced awareness, followed by early diagnosis
and management, may slow or halt the natural
progression of the disease and reduce the long term
burden of painful symptoms, including possibly
the risk of central sensitization, but no cure exists.
Furthermore, the evidence for modifiable risk factors
for endometriosis remains unacceptably sparse.12
Critically needed are large scale longitudinal studies
that can quantify modifiable exposures in girls and
young women in the pre-diagnostic, and ideally the
pre-symptomatic, window that are then explored
further in humans,105-107 as well as in experimental
models, to determine the physiologic pathways
defined by causal effects on the epigenome,
transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. To
date, few risk factors have been robustly replicated
in multiple populations, with the most consistently
associated with endometriosis including müllerian
anomalies, low birth weight and lean body size,
early age at menarche, short menstrual cycles,
and nulliparity.111 Less research has supported
associations with endocrine disrupting toxins
including diethystilbestrol.108
Clinical course
A critical aspect of care for women with endometriosis
is that associated symptoms progress and recede over
the life course, sometimes in response to treatment
and sometimes with age or altered environment
in pathways that we do not yet understand (fig 4).
For example, pain remediation is often a priority
among adolescents,109 whereas older women may
be focused on fertility or on life affecting fatigue.8 110

expression of genes implicated in the inflammation/
immune response, angiogenesis, and steroid
responsiveness (progesterone “resistance”).89 Shed
menstrual tissue contains high concentrations of
pro-inflammatory cytokines, proteases, and immune
cells, all of which may influence the peritoneal
microenvironment after reflux. Stem/progenitor cells
have been identified in the endometrium and are
thought to survive and implant onto the peritoneum,
contributing to lesions.83 Mesothelial cells line
the pelvic peritoneal cavity, and changes in their
function in women with endometriosis, including
altered morphology and metabolism (switch to
aerobic glycolysis)90 and production of factors that
promote immune cell recruitment and angiogenesis
are all thought to favor survival and establishment
of lesions.91 Physiological hormonal fluctuations in
women induce cyclical episodes of cell proliferation,
inflammation, injury, and repair within lesions that
favor fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and
fibrosis.

Diagnosis and monitoring
Although endometriosis has a highly variable
presentation, steps can be recommended for decision
making by general practitioners and gynecologists
to approach a “working diagnosis” of probable
endometriosis, implement treatment to remediate
endometriosis associated symptoms, and consider
multi-specialty collaboration for patient centered
whole healthcare (fig 5).
“Red flag” symptoms and signs
The diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered
in women (including girls aged 17 and under)
presenting with one (or more) of the following
symptoms or signs: chronic pelvic pain with or
without cyclic flares, dysmenorrhea (affecting daily
activities and quality of life), deep dyspareunia,
cyclical gastrointestinal symptoms (particularly
dyschezia), cyclical urinary symptoms (particularly
hematuria or dysuria), or infertility in association
with one (or more) of the preceding symptoms or
signs.114 Shoulder tip pain (pain under the shoulder
blade), catamenial pneumothorax, cyclical cough/
hemoptysis/chest pain, and cyclical scar swelling/pain
can indicate endometriosis at extra-abdominal sites.13
40 115 116
Fatigue is commonly reported by women with
endometriosis. An abdomino-pelvic examination may
help to identify ovarian and deep disease.117
Diagnostic biomarkers
Many research studies and Cochrane reviews have
assessed potential biomarkers for endometriosis,118-120
with the ultimate goal of reducing the delay that exists
in diagnosing endometriosis. Unfortunately, all of the
candidates investigated to date have proven nonspecific or unreliable, making them inappropriate for
routine clinical use.
the bmj | BMJ 2022;379:e070750 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2022-070750

Imaging to diagnose endometriosis
Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging
(ideally two dimensional, T2 weighted sequences
without fat suppression) can be used to diagnose
endometriosis preoperatively, but the absence of
findings on imaging does not exclude endometriosis,
particularly superficial peritoneal disease.121 122
Nevertheless, the ENDO Study enrolled 131
women from the general population who had not
presented for gynecologic evaluation, among whom
magnetic resonance imaging was used to diagnose
endometriosis in 11%.123 Although the sensitivity
of transvaginal ultrasonography is maximized only
for endometriomas, technological and training
advances are improving detection of all subphenotypes of endometriotic lesions.124 125 Saline
infusion sonoPODography is a novel technique
that may be able to diagnose superficial peritoneal
endometriosis on ultrasonography, although it needs
to be validated.126
Laparoscopic diagnosis and appearance of
endometriosis
In patients with suspected endometriosis, in whom
imaging has shown no obvious pelvic pathology or
for whom empirical treatment has been unsuccessful,
laparoscopy is recommended for diagnosis.
Laparoscopy for endometriosis should always involve
a comprehensive exploration of the abdominal and
pelvic contents. Histopathological confirmation
is ideal; however, histologic definitions for
endometriosis have remained stagnant for decades,
with a lower than expected sensitivity,12 particularly
among younger women with endometriosis.127
Superficial peritoneal endometriosis has been
described as having a black (powder burn) or dark
bluish appearance from the accumulation of blood
pigments (fig 2).128 However, lesions can appear
as white opacifications, red flame-like lesions, or
yellow-brown patches in earlier, active stages of
disease.129 Ovarian endometriomas have a distinct
morphology classically described as a “chocolate
cysts,” containing old menstrual blood, necrotic
fluid, and other poorly defined components that give
their contents a dark brown appearance. Adhesions
are often found in association with endometriomas
and consist of fibrous scar tissue resulting from
chronic inflammation. In many cases, endometriosis
is present at the site of ovarian fixation.130 Deep
endometriosis appears as multifocal nodules and
may infiltrate the surrounding viscera and peritoneal
tissue.131 Almost 40% of laparoscopies done for
pelvic pain do not identify any pathology.99 Clinicians
should always consider other pelvic and non-pelvic
visceral and somatic structures, as well as centrally
mediated pain factors, that could be generating or
contributing to the pain.99
“Working diagnosis” of probable endometriosis
In women with a high suspicion of endometriosis,
in whom imaging has not shown obvious pelvic
pathology and a laparoscopy has not been done or

Furthermore, a long held belief that endometriosis
and its symptoms do not occur in adolescents and
end at menopause was erroneous. However, the years
of perimenopause can be a time of increased pelvic
pain,111 112 with particular attention needing to be
paid to symptom management that may include an
unexpected return of pain in those patients for whom
a treatment regimen had been successful during
premenopause.113 Clinicians need to focus across
the life course on patient centered care, engaging
in a dialogue to capture evolving symptomatology
but also to collaborate on what symptoms are of
most importance to the patient at this life stage.110
Importantly, all that we believe we know about
endometriosis is limited to the characteristics and
natural history of those women who successfully
obtain a diagnosis. To whatever extent asymptomatic
or incidental findings have influenced the diagnostic
population or to whatever extent health disparities
or biases regarding symptom belief or access to
pain or infertility care have limited or skewed those
diagnosed, our elucidation of the true signs and
symptoms and prognosis of endometriosis will
evolve as care and access to it improves.11

Delayed diagnosis
Endometriosis can occur at any age, with some
patients reporting that pelvic pain symptoms arose
at or soon after thelarche or menarche. Among
women with endometriosis diagnosed in adulthood,
nearly a fifth report that their symptoms began
before age 20 and two thirds report onset before age
30.5 The exact time of disease onset is unknown for
endometriosis, as symptoms must emerge and be
sufficiently life affecting to gain referral for definitive
diagnosis. Furthermore, non-specific symptoms
such as dysmenorrhea have often been treated
with hormonal drugs without consideration of
endometriosis, whereas the current recommendation
is to be aware and consider a working diagnosis
of probable endometriosis. Thus, varied nonspecific symptomatology, normalization of pelvic
pain, clinicians’ awareness of endometriosis, and
economic and geographic access to care all contribute
to a delay averaging seven years from symptom onset
to surgical diagnosis.15
Long term monitoring of endometriosis
Follow-up, including psychological support,
should be considered in women with confirmed
endometriosis, with renewed evaluation and a
revised treatment plan if symptoms emerge, recur,
or worsen over time. However, no evidence exists of
benefit of regular long term monitoring (for example,
imaging) for early detection of endometriotic
lesion recurrence, complications, or malignant
transformation, in the absence of complex ovarian
masses or endometriosis with deep bowel effect.134
135
Given growing evidence of risk of multisystem
involving conditions (fig 4), patient centered whole
healthcare dictates that monitoring by general
practitioners for emergence of signs and symptoms
of mental health conditions, cardiovascular
disease, immunologic and autoimmune disorders,
gastrointestinal conditions, or multifocal pain
conditions should be heightened and referral to a
non-gynecologic specialist should be considered as
needed.
Management of endometriosis associated pain
The growing recognition that endometriosis
associated pain has a mixed pain phenotype (or
occupies different points on a continuum) supports
a personalized, multimodal, interdisciplinary
treatment approach,13 which might include surgical
ablation/excision of lesions, analgesics, hormonal
treatments, non-hormonal treatments including
neuromodulators, and non-drug therapies (or a
combination of the above).1 The evidence supporting
different surgical, pharmacologic, and non10

pharmacologic approaches to treating endometriosis
is examined below.
Surgical management of endometriosis associated
pain
The most recent guidelines for endometriosis (for
example, the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence (NICE), ESHRE) recommend surgery as a
treatment option to reduce endometriosis associated
pain.13 114 However, only a limited number of RCTs
have assessed pain outcomes after surgery (and most
are small, offer little detail on endometriosis subphenotypes visualized at surgery, and have a followup period of less than 12 months). Furthermore,
the authors of the most recent Cochrane review of
surgery for endometriosis associated pain concluded
that they were “uncertain of the effect of laparoscopic
surgery on pain and quality of life” owing to the low
quality of the available studies.136 They included
only two of the published RCTs (comparing
surgical treatment of endometriosis with diagnostic
laparoscopy alone) in their analysis of laparoscopic
excision to improve pain and quality of life.137 138 One
trial of 16 participants experiencing pain associated
with endometriosis assessed “overall pain” scores
at 12 months (mean difference on 0-100 visual
analog scale (VAS) 1.65, 95% confidence interval
1.11 to 2.19), and the other trial of 39 participants
assessed quality of life at six months measured using
the EuroQol-5D (mean difference 0.03, –0.12 to
0.18). The evidence of benefit for specific subtypes is
discussed in more detail below.

Surgery for superficial peritoneal endometriosis
Little evidence shows that surgery to treat isolated
superficial peritoneal endometriosis improves
overall symptoms and quality of life. The uncertainty
around surgical management of this subtype is
compounded by the limited evidence to allow an
informed selection of specific surgical modalities
to remove the lesions (for example, laparoscopic
ablation versus laparoscopic excision).139 140
Surgery for ovarian endometriosis
To our knowledge, no RCTs have compared cystectomy
versus no treatment in women with endometrioma
and measured the effect on painful symptoms. Also,
no published data indicate a threshold cyst size
below which surgery may be safely withheld in the
absence of suspicious features on imaging (surgery
is the only means by which a tissue specimen can
be obtained to rule out ovarian malignancy). Thus,
surgical excision is generally considered the optimal
treatment for ovarian endometriosis. Cystectomy,
instead of drainage and coagulation, is the preferred
surgical approach as it reduces recurrence of
endometrioma and endometriosis associated
pain.141 Cystectomy should be chosen with caution
for women who desire fertility, as a risk of fertility
affecting diminished ovarian reserve exists, and
a highly skilled conservative approach should be
applied to minimize ovarian damage.142

is awaited, giving a “working diagnosis” of probable
endometriosis and instigating early medical treatment
without waiting for a more definitive diagnosis can
be helpful.13 114 132 133 This is an emerging concept
for which some people use the terms “working” and
“clinical” diagnosis interchangeably.

State of the Art REVIEW

Hysterectomy for endometriosis
No RCTs on hysterectomy for the treatment of
endometriosis associated pain have been done. Most
published articles are retrospective case series, and
only a few prospective studies have been reported.
Hysterectomy (with or without oophorectomy) with
removal of all visible endometriosis lesions should be
reserved for women who no longer wish to conceive
and who have not responded to more conservative
management. Women with endometriosis should
be informed that hysterectomy is not a “cure” for
endometriosis and that it is best reserved for women
with coexisting adenomyosis (which does occur
inside the uterus) or for women with severe pain who
have exhausted all other options to improve their
symptoms.145 Recent longitudinal studies have not
found a benefit of bilateral oophorectomy for long
term pain management.145 146 Of note, BIPOC (black,
indigenous, and people of color) women are more
likely to have complications of hysterectomy, in part
because they are more likely to undergo laparotomy
rather than minimally invasive laparoscopy.147
Women should be informed that hysterectomy is
associated with long term morbidity,148 including
cardiovascular disease,56 among those with and
without surgically induced menopause.149 150
Recurrence or progression of endometriosis after
surgery
The reported recurrence rate of painful symptoms
attributed to endometriosis is high, estimated as
21.5% at two years and 40-50% at five years.146 151
However, although a purist’s definition of
“endometriosis recurrence” calls for “second look”
the bmj | BMJ 2022;379:e070750 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2022-070750

laparoscopy, it is most often diagnosed in the real
world on the basis of recurrence of symptoms alone.
In addition, no robust evidence exists to support
an ordered progression of endometriotic lesions.
In prospective studies of repeat surgeries, lesions
progressed (in 29% of cases), regressed (in 42%), or
were static (in 29%).152 Surgical treatment of certain
subtypes of endometriosis could also exacerbate
painful symptoms.153 154

Preoperative and postoperative hormone treatment
Preoperative hormone treatment has not been
shown to improve the immediate outcome of
surgery for pain, or reduce recurrence, in women
with endometriosis.155 A meta-analysis of 340
participants found that compared with surgery alone,
postoperative hormone treatment of endometriosis
reduced pelvic pain after 12 months (standardized
mean difference on VAS −0.79, −1.02 to −0.56),
but the evidence is very low quality.155 Women with
endometriosis who undergo hysterectomy with
oophorectomy should be advised to start continuous
combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for
at least the first few years after surgery.156 This may
be changed later to estrogen alone, but this needs to
be balanced with the theoretical risk of reactivation
and malignant transformation of any residual
endometriosis, which can occur many years later.
Pharmacologic management of endometriosis
associated pain
Analgesics
Most women with suspected or known endometriosis
use over-the-counter drugs, such as non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, the
available evidence to support their use is scarce.
The data on the benefit of NSAIDs are limited to one
small RCT.157 They can be useful as “breakthrough
medication” in the management of a pain flare.

Hormonal treatments
Hormone treatments for endometriosis include
combined
contraceptives,
progestogens,
gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists,
GnRH antagonists, and aromatase inhibitors (table
1). All of these hormone treatments (except the newer
GnRH antagonists, which have not been so extensively
studied) have been included in a multivariate
network meta-analysis of the outcomes “menstrual
pain” and “non-menstrual pelvic pain” (pain relief
on VAS; total of 1680 participants).114 All treatments
led to a clinically significant reduction in pain on
the VAS compared with placebo. The magnitude of
this treatment effect is similar for all treatments,
suggesting that little difference exists between them in
their capacity to reduce pain. Furthermore, symptoms
return after cessation of treatment and hormone
treatments used to manage endometriosis all have
side effects. In addition, although the contraceptive
properties of the hormones may be welcome if the
woman does not wish to become pregnant, they may
be unwanted if fertility is desired.

Surgery for deep endometriosis
Surgical treatment to completely excise deep
disease is generally considered to be the treatment
of choice.143 144 Nevertheless, most of the studies
that have reported improvements in quality of life
following surgical excision of deep endometriosis
(typically involving the bowel) have been done
in small cohorts of women, usually from single
centers, without a comparator arm, and this
affects the precision and generalizability of the
results. The largest multicenter prospective nonrandomized study published to date reported the
six, 12, and 24 month follow-up outcomes on nearly
5000 women undergoing laparoscopic excision of
deep rectovaginal endometriosis.143 This showed
clinically and statistically significant reductions in
premenstrual, menstrual, and non-cyclical pelvic
pain, deep dyspareunia, dyschezia, low back pain,
and bladder pain at 24 months (data from 524-560
participants for each symptom) with a corresponding
improvement in quality of life (575 participants,
median score on EuroQol-5D 76, 95% confidence
interval 75 to 80). Although the results should be
interpreted with caution, because data were missing
for >70% of patients at 24 months, assigned score
methods suggest that evidence of improvement
remained statistically significant.

Non-hormonal treatments
Analgesic tricyclic antidepressants (for example,
amitriptyline, nortriptyline), selective serotonin
uptake inhibitors (for example, duloxetine) and
anticonvulsants (for example, gabapentin and
pregabalin) are sometimes used clinically in the
treatment of endometriosis associated pain without
a strong evidence base.167 These “neuromodulatory
drugs” differ from conventional analgesics, such
as NSAIDs, in that they primarily affect the central
nervous system’s modulation of pain rather than
peripheral mediators of inflammation. However, in
a recent RCT for the management of chronic pelvic
pain (in the absence of endometriosis), gabapentin
was not shown to be superior to placebo and was
associated with dose limiting side effects.168
Non-drug management of endometriosis associated
pain
Pelvic physiotherapy
An increasing number of women with
endometriosis report anecdotal benefit from pelvic
physiotherapy. Physiotherapists may support
women with activity management (for example,
exercises, pacing strategies, and goal setting) and/
or use complementary approaches to manage their
pelvic pain symptoms (for example, massage and
trigger point release therapy). Establishing the
independent benefit of standalone physiotherapy
is difficult, because most studies have assessed it
in combination with psychological and medical
management.169 Two small pilot studies assessed
the outcome of manipulations and massage for
relief of endometriosis associated pain specifically,
but they included specific patient groups and
need expansion and replication to support
recommendations for care of endometriosis
patients.170 171
12

Psychology
The most common psychologically based
intervention for chronic pain is cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT). Most of the studies of CBT in women
with endometriosis are of low quality, designed
using different methods and based on different
psychological frameworks (making separation of
effects difficult). However, given that CBT has been
evaluated across a spectrum of other chronic pain
disorders and shown to be effective for developing
pain coping strategies,98 99 172 it should be integrated
into individualized treatment plans when needed.
Dietary intervention
Diet has been postulated to affect symptoms of
endometriosis. However, very few studies (all of
limited quality) have evaluated the benefit of dietary
interventions and their effect on endometriosis
symptoms. Supplements, such as omega-3
polyunsaturated fatty acids (O-PUFAs), have been
investigated as a way of reducing inflammation
and pain in endometriosis.173 174 In a recent review,
decreased pain scores were observed in women
with endometriosis after use of O-PUFAs, which
were not seen in controls.175 Clinicians should
be aware that women with endometriosis have
an increased risk of co-presenting with irritable
bowel syndrome concomitant with endometriosis
associated dyschezia.44 Patients are not uncommonly
referred for gastroenterology evaluation without
consideration of potential endometriosis.45

Surgery to increase chance of natural pregnancy
Moderate quality evidence from a Cochrane metaanalysis of three RCTs in a total of 528 participants
shows that laparoscopic treatment (ablation or
excision) of superficial peritoneal endometriosis
increases viable intrauterine pregnancy rates
compared with diagnostic laparoscopy only (odds
ratio 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.25 to 2.86).136
We found no data on live birth rates, and the effect on
ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage rates is unclear.
No published RCTs have assessed fertility outcomes
after surgery for ovarian or deep disease, and surgery
is generally recommended only in the presence
of painful symptoms.13 Use of the Endometriosis
Fertility Index to support decision making for the
most appropriate option to achieve pregnancy after
surgery (for example, women who may benefit from
medically assisted reproduction) has been recently
suggested.13 68
Medically assisted reproduction
Low quality evidence shows that viable intrauterine
pregnancy rates are increased in women with
superficial peritoneal endometriosis if they undergo
intrauterine insemination with ovarian stimulation,
instead of expectant management or intrauterine
insemination alone. In one RCT of 103 participants
randomized either to ovarian stimulation with
gonadotrophins and intrauterine insemination
treatment or to expectant management, the live birth
rate was 5.6 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 17.4)
times higher in the treated couples.177 In women with
ovarian or deep endometriosis, the benefit of ovarian
stimulation with intrauterine insemination is unclear.
No RCTs have evaluated the efficacy of assisted
reproductive technology (ART) versus no intervention
in women with endometriosis. Recommendations
in guidelines suggesting that ART may be effective
for endometriosis associated infertility have been
based on meta-analyses of observational studies
comparing the outcomes of ART in women with
and without endometriosis.13 178 179 Doing surgery
before ART for infertility associated with superficial
peritoneal endometriosis is not recommended, as
the evidence suggesting benefit is based on a single
retrospective study of low quality180 (and is not
supported by indirect evidence from multiple studies
comparing outcomes in women with surgically
treated endometriosis and those managed without
surgery179). Doing surgery for ovarian endometrioma
before ART to improve live birth rates is also not
recommended. Current evidence shows no benefit,
and surgery is likely to have a negative effect on
ovarian reserve.181 182 In addition, no evidence shows
that doing surgical excision of deep endometriosis
before ART improves reproductive outcomes, and
this should be reserved for women with concomitant
painful symptoms.

Specialist endometriosis centers
Specialist centers were first formally proposed in
2006,183 and this model of care has been successfully
implemented in the UK and several other European
countries such as Denmark, Germany, and
France.184 185 The role of specialist endometriosis
centers should be to offer a coordinated, holistic,
multidisciplinary, multimodal approach to women
with complex symptoms of endometriosis that are
experienced and evolve across the life course (fig 5).
Although relevant surgical expertise is important,
the role of a center is not to focus solely on surgical
treatment to eradicate lesions. Thus, a specialist
center should offer an integrated service, including
gynecologists, colorectal surgeons, urologists,
endometriosis specialist nurses, pain medicine
specialists, psychologists, physiotherapists, fertility
specialists, and imaging experts.
Guidelines
Various national and international organizations
have issued guidelines for the assessment and
management of endometriosis. We reviewed and
compared nine of these guidelines (including the
recent 2022 update of the ESHRE guideline).186-193
All of the guidelines recommend the combined
oral contraceptive pill and progestogens for
endometriosis associated pain, but they differ in the
recommendations around “second line” medical
treatments. All of the guidelines recommend
laparoscopic surgery for the management of
endometriosis associated pain, although some
acknowledge the lack of evidence for surgery in the
management of pain associated with superficial
peritoneal endometriosis specifically.13 114 No clear
consensus exists regarding surgical treatment for
endometriosis associated infertility, especially with
regard to the management of an endometrioma
before assisted reproduction.
Emerging diagnostic tools and treatments
Most endometriosis research studies to date have
been underfunded and on a small scale, and have
involved poorly defined populations of women
and samples captured from those who receive a
diagnosis well along in their endometriosis journey.
However, real hope exists of a breakthrough in
the development of a biomarker to diagnose
endometriosis closer to emergence and earlier in
its natural progression, and to predict response to
treatment, owing to the establishment of globally
harmonized endometriosis protocols for clinical data
and human tissue collection.105-107 The biomarker
field will also hopefully benefit from new insights
being gained from the study of serum microRNAs and
metabolomics.194 195 Preclinical studies of new nonhormonal medical treatments have offered insights
by focusing on inflammation, pain, and metabolism
as the platform for repurposing of drugs already
approved for other conditions.19 90 196 Increasing
evidence also suggests that the “gut-brain axis” could
be a novel therapeutic target for pain symptom relief

Conclusion
Endometriosis is a prevalent, often life affecting
condition that in most women emerges during
adolescence and can evolve to include symptoms
and conditions encompassing multiple systems.
Endometriosis demands to be known, considered,
and tackled by all practitioners—general and
specialist—who treat female patients at all stages
across the life course. Patient centered whole
healthcare requires a dialog between a woman and
her healthcare practitioners to monitor symptom
remediation, persistence, or recurrence and to
prioritize the focus of care—for example, fatigue
remediation when sports participation is paramount,
fertility when family building is desired, a revision
of medical treatment during perimenopause, or
early response to signs of cardiovascular changes.
Stigma around menstrual health and chronic pain
remain all too ubiquitous barriers to high quality
Questions for future research

• What causes endometriosis?
• Can a non-invasive screening tool be developed to
aid the diagnosis of endometriosis?
• What are the most effective ways of maximizing and/
or maintaining fertility in women with confirmed or
suspected endometriosis?
• What are the most effective ways of managing the
emotional, psychological, and/or fatigue related
impact of living with endometriosis?
• Can we predict the outcomes and/or success rates for
surgical or medical treatments for endometriosis?
• What are the most effective non-surgical ways
of managing endometriosis related pain and/or
symptoms?

Patient involvement

We consulted Emma Cox, chief executive of
Endometriosis UK, a nationally recognized
representative and voice of patients with
endometriosis, in the development of this review, and
she commented on the draft and final manuscript. No
patients were involved directly in the preparation of
this article.

healthcare. Awareness in the general public and
among healthcare providers is essential.
Once their symptoms are acknowledged and
treated, most patients with endometriosis do well.
However, despite overcoming diagnostic delays and
access to state of the art treatment, some experience
persistence or progression of symptoms. Critical next
steps for discovery include defining sub-phenotypes
of endometriosis that classify patients into groups
that are predictive of prognosis and the natural
course of the condition and indicate selection of
treatments most likely to be successful to restore high
quality of life. We must also answer foundational
questions that remain about the causes and natural
progression of endometriosis that need expanded
funding and attraction of multidisciplinary
scientists from all areas of population and bench
science. Recommendations to permit a “working
diagnosis” of probable endometriosis are having an
effect on patient centered care and faster symptom
remediation. Through the work of endometriosis
associations, non-governmental organizations, and
the endometriosis community across the globe,
awareness of endometriosis has increased in recent
years, along with some increases in funding. We are
early on the necessary trajectory, but the journey is
gaining speed.
In addition to invaluable insight provided by Emma Cox, we thank
Naoko Sasamoto and Marzieh Ghiasi for early design of figures 1 and
4, which were further adapted by SAM for this review; Kevin Kuan
for designing figure 3 in BioRender; and Dan Martin for contributing
image 1 to figure 2.

in endometriosis.197 Microbiomes likely play a role in
the gut-brain axis, are associated with the spectrum of
symptoms associated with endometriosis, and are an
exciting putative therapeutic target. Lastly, although
randomized evaluations of surgical interventions for
endometriosis have been rare (and some interventions
have been adopted without rigorous evaluation),
we are witnessing important collaboration between
research and surgical communities to conduct large
scale, appropriate, and well designed trials (for
example, PRE-EMPT (https://www.birmingham.

ed.ac.uk/centre-reproductive-health/esprit2), and
DIAMOND (https://w3.abdn.ac.uk/hsru/DIAMOND/
Public/Public/index.cshtml)). Surgical trials are
difficult to undertake successfully and pose practical
and methodological challenges. However, the
inherent value of a well conducted RCT to predict the
outcomes and/or success rates of surgical treatments
for endometriosis should not be overlooked.
