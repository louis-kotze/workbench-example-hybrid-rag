ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Introduction: Endometriosis is a chronic painful condition characterized by high prognostic
uncertainty, as well as the threat of infertility and emotional symptoms that may affect many
aspects of women, including psychological characteristics like dispositional optimism.
Considering the impact of endometriosis on psychological health and the paucity of papers on
this topic, the aim of this study is to explore optimism and associated factors in endometriosis.
Methods: A case-control study was performed on a group of 95 women with endometriosis
and 156 controls. All participants completed the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), a selfadministered tool for assessing dispositional optimism. Pain severity, medication, gynecological
and socio-demographic information was also collected.
Results: Low optimism was observed for women with endometriosis compared to controls even
after covariate adjustment (LOT-R global scores: 14.5 vs. 15.9 points, p ¼ .045).
Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that a personality dimension with many
prognostic implications may be altered in women with endometriosis. Our findings highlight
the importance of a broader understanding of this condition, treating this disorder from a biopsychosocial perspective and suggests the need for non-medical attention within a multidisciplinary team.

Introduction
Endometriosis is a chronic estrogen-dependent,
inflammatory condition that affects 10–15% women
especially during their reproductive years [1]. Patients
present a wide variety of symptoms, including chronic
pain, infertility, higher risk of ovarian cancer [2] and
metabolic and emotional symptoms [3]. Women with
endometriosis may have a wide range of pain symptoms that vary significantly among patients and do
not always correlate with the clinical severity of the
disease [3–6]. This suggests that other variables, such
as coping strategies, or psychological traits, may influence the perception of the pain [7]. Patients with
endometriosis face the challenge of this multidimensional disorder and must cope with their new

situation. This can be affected by multiple factors,
including the women’s individual predispositions such
us dispositional optimism which may impact a person’s acceptance of the situation of being diagnosed
with a chronic disease [8].
Dispositional optimism has been conceptualized as
a stable personality characteristic that reflects the
extent to which people hold generalized favorable
expectations for the future [9]. This personality trait is
associated with taking proactive measures to protect
health [10] and with lower risk of psychopathology
and better treatments outcomes [9]. It is resistant to
downturn by adversity [11,12] but may be also variations in optimism, both moment-to-moment and
over extended periods [13]. According to the theory of

self-regulation [12], positive outcome expectancies
may decrease when people are confronted with a succession of major adversities [14–16]. For example, in a
study that determined the sensitivity of optimism to
stressors of chronic disease comparing diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis and healthy controls, authors
found that optimistic bias in chronically ill patients
was lower compared to healthy people [17].
Why can dispositional optimism be affected in
endometriosis? A qualitative research study on 30
women diagnosed with endometriosis showed they
were aware that there was no cure for their condition.
Even when relief is obtained with a particular treatment, there is no certainty about how long it will last.
Patients experience “treatment uncertainty” (regarding
medical encounters and the trial and error approach
to treatments), “symptomatic uncertainty” and
“trajectory uncertainty” (related to the uncertainty
about their future and the course of their disease) [4].
Another qualitative study of 24 patients diagnosed
with endometriosis also explored womens concerns
and impact of illness upon the quality of life [18].
Future pain and future fertility were the main issues of
concern for women in both studies [4,18]. However, it
would be interesting to know which was first, the disease or the altered personality trait and thus establish
the direction of causality [19]. We may argue whether
endometriosis itself is the cause or the consequence
of lower optimism or whether some aspects of the disease, such as infertility or pain, are associated with
mental suffering and modify some personality traits.
Although several studies have emphasized the
importance of examining the role of individual differences in women’s subjective experience of endometriosis, including pain perception [20–22], most studies
have been focused on physiological and diagnostic
dimensions [23]. Previous research that investigated
the association between pelvic pain caused by endometriosis and personality concluded that patients with
painful endometriosis were more likely to avoid new
potentially risky situations and experience pessimistic
worries [7]. These worries together with fear, hopelessness and hypervigilance toward pain, may not only
influence pain perception but also hinder the effectiveness of therapy by affecting patients’ responses to
treatment [7]. Dispositional optimism has been studied
in many medical conditions but the research on gynecological diseases is quite scarce [8,24]. For all these
reasons, we consider so important to investigate optimism in endometriosis. To the best of our knowledge,
no previous studies about optimism have been conducted
on
women
with
these
conditions

51

(endometriomas and Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis).
We hypothesize that women with endometriomas and
DIE show lower optimism compared to women without the disease. Thus, the aim of the study was to
assess dispositional optimism and associated factors
in women with endometriomas and DIE compared
to controls.

Methods
This case-control study was carried out in a tertiary
hospital, between September 2014 and May 2015.
Two gynecologists using the same methodology performed all clinical evaluations. Cases (n ¼ 95) were
women attending the Endometriosis Unit of the
Hospital. Diagnoses were established by medical history and confirmed by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)
using a Voluson E-8wand 4–9 MHz transducer;
(General Electric Healthcare, USA). For ultrasound
exploration, we followed the method described by
Guerriero et al., in case of ovarian endometriomas [25]
and Abrao et al., for DIE cases [26]. When a patient
presented both types of endometriosis (DIE and endometriomas), she was classified as DIE. All women having disease were diagnosed by 2 D, but for DIE cases,
3 D was also used (30% of cases). Patients were
excluded from the study if they were pregnant, or if
they had oncological treatment or genitourinary prolapse. Controls were women without endometriosis
attending the gynecological outpatient clinic for routine exams (n ¼ 156). Nine controls reported clinical
symptoms compatible with endometriosis but the
diagnosis was not confirmed by TVUS. All participants
completed health questionnaires, gynecological and
obstetrical histories and clinical and socio-demographic information at a scheduled visit. For both
groups, consecutive women attending the clinic were
recruited by gynecologists, and more than 95% of the
approached women agreed to participate in the study.
The ones that refused to participate were due to a
lack of time for filling out questionnaires.
Variables that are related to optimism according to
previous research were also collected (pain severity,
professional situation, education, infertility and treatment for emotional disorders) [6,8,9,13,24,27]. Pain
severity was evaluated using the SF12v2 bodily pain
subscale, one of the eight subscales of the SF-12v2
Health Survey [28]. This test is a validated shorter version of the SF-36v2 that encompasses 12 questions,
which evaluates functional health and wellbeing from
the participant’s point of view [29]. All raw scale
scores are linearly converted to a 0–100 scale, with

52

higher scores representing higher levels of healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) [30]. All subscales and
both summary measures were also converted to normative-based scores according to the SF-12v2 recommendations to give a mean of 50 and a standard
deviation of 10, using a representative sample of the
US general population [29]. The SF-12v2 is a valid
instrument to measure HRQoL in our environment and
has been previously used in Spanish populations [28,30,31].
Dispositional optimism was assessed using the Life
Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R), which is the most
widely used test to assess dispositional optimism [32].
It has been translated into many languages including
Spanish [33]. The results indicated that the properties
of the Spanish version [34] of the LOT-R were similar
to those of the original test, and internal consistency
reliability was acceptable for the total scale according
to Cronbach’s coefficient alphas (a ¼ .72). This 10-item
validated self-report instrument has three statements
that measure optimism, three statements that measure
pessimism and the remaining four statements are filler
questions. Respondents were asked to rate on a fivepoint Likert scale the extent to which each item is
true or false. The total sum score is calculated by adding the optimism score and the inverted pessimism
score. Total score ranges between 0 and 24 points
with higher scores denoting more optimism. Written
informed consent was obtained from all women. The
study was approved by the Ethics Research
Committee of the University of Murcia (no. 770/2013;
October 3, 2013).

Statistical analyses
Analyses were conducted using the version 20 of the
software program SPSS. Prior to analysis, normality
and homogeneity of variance were tested. Descriptive
statistics were presented using raw data. Continuous
variables were compared using unpaired Student Ttests, and categorical variables were analyzed using
Pearson’s v2 tests. With the analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA), adjusted differences in LOT-R scores
between cases and controls were assessed. Effect sizes
were calculated using Cohen’s d, relating the mean
score differences to the pooled standard deviation
[35]. Age, education level, employment and marital
status, infertility/sterility problems, bodily pain and
psychiatric medication were included as potential confounders/covariates in the model, to obtain a better
adjustment. All tests were two-tailed at .05 significance level. From previous publications, we considered

it would be appropriate to detect a difference of at
least 1.3 points (with a standard deviation of about
3.5 points) in the LOT global score between cases and
controls for sample size calculation. If we accept a risk
of 0.05 and 80% of statistical power to detect differences, if there are any, we would require 92 subjects in
one group and 151 in the other one.

Results
Table 1 gives a complete overview of the socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of participants.
Cases were older than controls (36.2 ± 7.5 vs.
30.7 ± 5.9 years, p < .001) and reported higher rates of
fertility problems (30.7% vs. 8.4%, p < .001). Women
with endometriosis had higher levels of bodily pain
than controls -lower scores in the SF12v2 questionnaire (66.6 ± 30.2 vs. 90.5 ± 18.3 points, p < .001).
There were also significant differences between cases
and controls regarding marital or employment status
and educational level (p < .001).

Figure 1. Adjusted mean LOT-R Optimism, LOT-R Pessimism
and LOT-R Global scores and 95% confidence intervals.

LOT-R optimism mean score was significantly higher in
controls (8.3 vs.7.5 points; p ¼ .01). On the other
hand, cases obtained a slightly higher LOT-R pessimism score than controls, (5.0 vs. 4.3 points; p ¼ .02),
but this relationship did not persist after adjustment
(p ¼ .24). Finally, controls obtained a LOT-R global
score of 1.4 points higher than cases (p ¼ .004) even
after the adjustment (p ¼ .045), which indicates higher
levels of optimism in controls. The effect size of this
difference was moderate (d ¼ .39). A sensitivity analysis was performed excluding nine control women
presenting symptoms consistent with endometriosis
and similar results were obtained.

Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
specifically evaluate dispositional optimism in a sample of women with endometriosis in a case-control
design. In this childbearing-aged sample of Spanish
women, lower optimism was observed for women
with endometriosis compared to controls. There is an
actual trend of finding new ways to supplement the
traditionally deficit-oriented perspective in psychological research [9]. Our study might contribute to
explore other aspects of psychological well-being of
women with endometriosis besides anxiety and
depression [5,20].
The available data on optimism among persons
suffering from gynecological diseases is meager.
Optimism has only been studied in the context of
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) and in vitro fertilization treatments [8,24]. These authors conclude that
response to in vitro fertilization treatments may be
hindered by personality characteristics. Very little
research has focused on gynecological conditions
using standardized instruments, such as the LOT-R

53

scale, the most widely used test for assessing dispositional optimism [32]. No previous research has
applied the LOT-R questionnaire in women with
endometriosis, but dispositional optimism has been
studied in the context of PCOS another chronic gynecological condition with important emotional repercussions [8]. This study found LOT-R global scores of
13.56 ± 4.28 points in women diagnosed with PCOS,
findings quite similar to ours. Hinz et al. [9] applied
the LOT-R questionnaire in general population and
found in 257 women with an age similar to our controls, total scores slightly higher than ours (17.1 vs.
15.6 points). The low occurrence of gender and age
differences in that study (the effect size of the difference was low, d ¼ .12), justifies reporting normative
data for the whole population, without differentiating
between age and gender groups, so the mean scores
presented as reference values were as follows: optimism 8.8 ± 2.5 points; pessimism 4.5 ± 2.4 points and
global scores 16.2 ± 3.8 points. Our controls have
similar global and optimism scores but higher pessimism scores (7.6 vs. 4.5 points).
A growing body of evidence suggests that people
may alter their personality profiles after developing
ongoing pain, even if personality traits are considered
to be relatively stable [7,19,36]. There is evidence that
in individuals with chronic pain, some personality
traits may be modified through psychological therapy
[37]. If personality traits can be influenced through
therapy, it may be possible to conclude that, an
altered personality trait may, in fact, have been developed as a consequence of the pain itself [19]. Other
authors have concluded that there are, at least for
some people, variations in optimism both from
moment to moment and over prolonged periods of
time [13]. We agree with authors’ statements that illness, or its associated symptoms, can modify some
personality traits. In our study, we have taken into
account factors such as fertility or pain severity that
may affect optimism. Even after controlling for these
variables, dispositional optimism was lower in endometriosis. In this sense, we hypothesize that the mere
awareness of having endometriosis may be associated
with lower optimism. The burden of a chronic condition characterized by uncertainty may affect this psychological trait [4], as has been reported for other
chronic conditions, such as diabetes mellitus or multiple sclerosis [17].
Our findings may have clinical and research implications. As optimism is related to pain perception,
psychopathology risk and response to treatments
[19], we consider that to correctly address

54

endometriosis would require an integrated approach,
combining medical and psychological interventions,
such as personality assessment. It might be very useful to involve other health providers, such as psychotherapists, in the treatment of endometriosis [38].
This multidisciplinary team will be able to complement much-needed expertise for the management of
endometriosis [3]. In this sense, the approach to
every woman with endometriosis should be individualized, proposing the best treatment options based
on the different symptoms and problems distressing
the patient, and taking into account her priorities
and preferences [7]. In order to improve health and
well-being outcomes, our findings suggest that we
need to attribute more importance and effort to
therapeutic strategies targeted on psychological
dimensions such as dispositional optimism [19].
Further studies are needed to evaluate effectiveness
of targeted psychotherapies.
Selection and measurement bias has to be considered. Controls were women attending the public hospital in the same period, and they stem from the
same population from which cases emerged. TVUS
cannot replace surgery for the diagnosis of noninvasive endometriosis, but TVUS has a high values for
sensitivity (93%) and specificity (96%) for endometriomas [39] and a sensitivity of 78–98% and specificity of
90–100% for diagnosis of DIE [40]. Nonetheless, misclassification of endometriosis may have occurred, but,
if present, it would contribute to underestimating the
true magnitude of the association. Another limitation
arises from the fact that the research was cross-sectional and there is no information about optimism
prior to the diagnosis of endometriosis, so it is difficult
to establish the direction of causality. This nuance has
been already discussed.
In conclusion, endometriosis is a multidimensional
disease with a wide variety of symptoms, including
pain and emotional symptoms that can affect many
aspects of women’s life. This study shows that a personality dimension with many prognostic implications
might be altered as a consequence of endometriosis.
Our findings highlight the importance of a broader
understanding of endometriosis, treating this disorder
from a biopsychosocial perspective and suggest the
need for non-medical attention within a multidisciplinary team.
