ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

The aim of this study was to understand the relationship between
psychosocial factors, including mental health, pain cognitions and
social support associated with menstrual pain severity in women
with dysmenorrhea of no identified medical cause (primary dysme­
norrhea; PD) and dysmenorrhea related to endometriosis.
Participants included 1192 women aged 18–50 years with men­
strual pain, recruited to an online cross-sectional survey in 2019.
Questionnaires assessed self-reported menstrual pain severity,
depression, anxiety, stress, pain catastrophizing, and social support.
Women with endometriosis had significantly higher menstrual pain
severity (p < 0.001) and pain catastrophizing (p < 0.001) than
women with PD. Of the psychosocial factors, only pain catastrophiz­
ing (specifically, the helplessness sub-scale) predicted menstrual
pain severity in each group. Overall, 36% of women with PD and
58% with endometriosis had clinically relevant levels of pain cata­
strophizing. Findings suggest a common psychological mechanism
in women with menstrual pain, regardless of etiology. Interventions
to reduce pain helplessness may be beneficial in supporting
women with dysmenorrhea.

Background
Dysmenorrhea, or menstrual pain, affects up to 95% of menstruating women and is
associated with poor quality of life (Iacovides et al., 2015). Primary dysmenorrhea (PD)
refers to painful cramps without evident pelvic pathology, while secondary dysmenor­
rhea involves pelvic abnormalities, including endometriosis (Harel, 2006). Endometriosis
involves the growth of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus and is a debilitating
condition associated with pain and infertility (Lagana et al., 2017; Vitale et al., 2017).

The experience of dysmenorrhea is best understood from a biopsychosocial perspec­
tive (Speer et al., 2016). For example, there is little relationship between the extent of
disease and endometriosis symptom severity, highlighting the role of drivers beyond
organic disease (Nunnink & Meana, 2007). As psychological and social processes likely
interact with biological processes in dysmenorrhea (Joseph & Mills, 2019), further
research is needed to understand the relationship between modifiable variables, such as
psychological symptoms, pain cognitions, social support, and menstrual pain, to inform
the development of targeted biopsychosocial interventions.
Psychological symptoms are frequently associated with higher rates of dysmenorrhea,
particularly in women with endometriosis (Pope et al., 2015). Pain catastrophizing, a pain
cognition involving lack of control and the expectation of negative outcomes related to
a painful experience, is associated with worse pain and health-related outcomes in
women with dysmenorrhea (Walsh et al., 2003). In contrast, social support can act as
a protective factor in physical and psychological health, directly through social relation­
ships and indirectly to safeguard against stressful situations (Reblin & Uchino, 2008). For
example, a cross-sectional study of 360 university students found that women with low
social support were 4.3 times more likely to have dysmenorrhea (Faramarzi & Salmalian,
2014). While social support may act as a protective factor, pain can also result in lower
social support through withdrawal from social activities, in a self-perpetuating cycle
(Wallace et al., 2014). At present, studies have neglected to examine the combined
predictive utility of social and psychological factors in dysmenorrhea, as well as which
type of companion (i.e. family, friend, significant other) may be important.
The aims of this study were to examine the psychosocial profile of pain in women with
dysmenorrhea. Exploring differences between PD and dysmenorrhea related to endome­
triosis is clinically valuable for understanding the specific profile of endometriosis. Given
the substantial burden of endometriosis, it is likely that the psychosocial functioning of
women with endometriosis will be particularly compromised. We hypothesize that 1)
women with endometriosis will have a more compromised psychosocial profile (higher
pain catastrophizing, more symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, and reduced
social support) compared to women with PD; and 2) psychosocial variables (higher pain
catastrophizing and symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress, and reduced social
support) will together predict menstrual pain severity in both groups.

Methods
Participants and procedures
The study was an online cross-sectional survey. Eligible participants were women aged
18–50 living in Australia, having experienced a period in the past 12 months. Participants
were recruited through University forums, via social media sites (e.g. Facebook), and
women’s gyms during May-August 2019. An online link directed participants to a webbased survey created using Qualtrics, which involved online consent. The survey took
30 minutes to complete. Participation involved completion of the 171 items. Participants
were offered the chance to win 1 of 5 100 USD vouchers. The study was approved by the
University Human Ethics Advisory Group.

Data Screening: A total of 2,899 individuals expressed interest in the study. Those
who did not meet inclusion criteria included: no period within last 12 months (n = 138),
residing outside Australia (n = 32), not identifying as female (n = 10), not aged 18–
50 years (n = 532), and no consent (n = 15) – with a sample of 2172 attempting the
survey. Of those, we excluded 801 women who did not complete the survey, leaving 1371
women. The mean menstrual pain rating of those who completed the survey was
significantly higher than those who did not complete the survey, although both displayed
means in the moderate pain range and the difference was not deemed as minimally
clinically important, defined as a difference of 1.74 (Farrar et al., 2001) (6.55 [2.3] vs 6.23
[2.4] respectively, p = 0.005). A further 179 women scored below 4 on the menstrual pain
NRS and were excluded, leaving a final sample of 1192 women.
Sample Characteristics: Participant mean age was 29.5 years (SD 7.76). Almost 44%
of women identified as having endometriosis (n = 519), with 86% reporting diagnosis via
laparoscopy (n = 446). While there were no significant group differences between PD and
endometriosis on tertiary education, divorce status, and part-time employment, there
was a small but significant difference in age (PD: 28.62 [8.2] years; endometriosis: 30.88
[7.1] years, p < 0.001), and duration of menstrual pain (PD: 12.22 years [7.3] years;
endometriosis: 15.48 [7.1] years, p < 0.001) (Table 1).

Measures
Demographics and Dysmenorrhea Survey. Demographic questions included age,
ethnicity(s), education level, marital status, and employment status. Dysmenorrhea
items included age at first menses, menstrual pain duration, use of the contraceptive
pill, and endometriosis diagnosis, including ‘have you ever received a diagnosis of
endometriosis’ and ‘how was this diagnosis made (e.g. pelvic exam, laparoscopy?)’.

Dysmenorrhea. An 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess menstrual
pain severity, from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain possible)(Chen et al., 2015).
Dysmenorrhea was defined as having at least moderate ‘period pain’, as evidenced by
an NRS rating of ‘4’ and above (Vincent et al., 2011). Women who rated pain at a ‘3’ or
lower were excluded. The NRS has good construct validity and extensive use in women
with menstrual pain (Chen et al., 2015; Hawker et al., 2011).
Pain Catastrophizing Scale. The 13 item Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) measures
rumination, magnification, and feeling helpless about pain (Sullivan, 2009). The PCS
yields a total score (0–52) and three subscale scores (rumination, magnification, and
helplessness), with a higher score indicating higher pain catastrophizing. A total score of
30 or above is associated with a clinically relevant level of catastrophizing (Sullivan,
2009). Internal consistency in the current study was excellent (α = 0.95), consistent with
previous research (Wheeler et al., 2019).
Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21). A 21-item self-report scale that assess
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress (Osman et al., 2012). Participants were asked
to rate how much the items applied to them over the past week on a 4-point scale, from 0
(did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much, or most the time). Internal
consistency of the three subscales were good (α = 0.92, 0.83, 0.86, respectively), consistent
with previous research (Sinclair et al., 2012).
Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS). A 12-item self-report
measure of perceived social support from family, friends, and a significant other (Zimet,
1988). In line with previous research, internal consistency of the overall scale was
excellent (α ¼ 0.93).

Data analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics 25. Continuous variables
were compared using t-tests; comparisons between discrete variables were analysed
using chi-square tests, with post-hoc differences examined using standardized resi­
duals (significant >1.96). Linear multiple regression was performed to determine
which of the psychosocial variables were most important for menstrual pain. The
amount of unique variance explained by a predictor was calculated by squaring the
semi-partial correlation. A Bonferroni correction was used to account for the
number of predictors (3 sub-scales for each of the PCS, DASS and MSPSS scales,
and the total of each; alpha = .05 was divided by 12), such that statistical signifi­
cance was set at .004 for regressions. Missing data rate for the study was below 2%
for each scale.
A post-hoc examination of common method variance (CMV). We quantified CMV
using Harmans single-factor method and observed common variance of 34.71%, below
the threshold of 50%. We further examined for bias using the CFA marker methodol­
ogy outlined by Williams, Hartmann, and Cavazotte (2010). The initial model was
a good fit (CFI = 0.968; RMSEA = .052), but the fit reduced substantially through
iterative marker models (CFIs = 0.169 to 0.317; RMSEAs = .225 to .271. Chi-square fit
was significant in all models (initial model = χ2(24) = 141.1, p < .001), but this is likely
due to the large sample. Only the factor loading for PSP Friends reduced by about one-

third from the baseline model to the unconstrained (Beta = 0.645; 0.437). As such, we
found little evidence to suggest common method bias (Williams & McGonagle, 2016).

Results
Psychosocial differences between women with PD and endometriosis
As shown in Table 2, after adjusting for multiple comparisons, dysmenorrhea ratings
were higher in the endometriosis group (PD mean = 6.71; endometriosis mean = 7.88,
t = −14.04, p < .0001), however a pain NRS difference of 1.17 is not considered clinically
significant (Farrar et al., 2001). After accounting for multiple comparisons, there were
also significant group difference on catastrophizing (PD mean = 24.38; endometriosis
mean = 30.81, t = −9.44, p < .0001). The endometriosis group had a higher proportion of
scores greater than 30 on the PCS (endometriosis: 58%; PD: 36%, χ2(1) = 54.96,
p < 0.0001). There were no significant group differences in depression, anxiety, stress,
or social support.

Predictors of menstrual pain severity in the PD group
The Durbin-Watson statistic of 1.91 indicated that the data were not autocorrelated. As
demonstrated in Table 3, our model including rumination, magnification, helplessness
(PCS), depression, anxiety, stress (DASS-21), and support (MSPSS) showed statistical
significance, accounting for 22% of the variance in menstrual pain [F = 19.99 (9, 653),
p < 0.001]. When examined individually, only the helplessness subscale of the PCS was
significant, accounting for approximately 7% of variance in menstrual pain.

Predictors of menstrual pain severity in the endometriosis group
The Durbin-Watson statistic of 2.08 indicated that the data were not autocorrelated. The
psychosocial predictors overall accounted for 18% of the variance in menstrual pain
[F = 12.30 (9, 501), p < 0.001]. Similar to the PD findings, only helplessness was
a significant individual predictor, accounting for 8% of variance in menstrual pain.
Regressions were repeated for PD and endometriosis, controlling for differences between
the groups, including age and length of menstrual pain, but there were no changes to
significant findings.

Discussion
This is the first study to examine a range of psychosocial predictors of menstrual pain in
a large sample of women reporting dysmenorrhea with and without endometriosis. Our
hypothesis that women with endometriosis would demonstrate compromised psychoso­
cial functioning compared to women with PD was partially supported. Women with
endometriosis had significantly higher menstrual pain (although not clinincally mean­
ingful), and pain catastrophizing (helplessness, magnification, and rumination), but not
depression, anxiety, stress, or poor social support. We found a similar pattern of
psychosocial predictors across groups, with pain helplessness significantly predicting
menstrual pain severity. Prior research has documented the importance of catastrophiz­
ing in understanding pain in a range of chronic conditions, including endometriosis
(McPeak et al., 2018). The present study extends this literature by demonstrating that
pain helplessness may be especially important in understanding dysmenorrhea, regard­
less of etiology.
A large proportion of women with dysmenorrhea, particularly endometriosis, are at
risk of poor outcomes. Scoring over 30 on the PCS is deemed clinically relevant with
a high risk of disability (Sullivan, 2009). In the current study, one third of women with
PD and over half with endometriosis reported PCS scores over 30, suggesting risk of
poor health-related outcomes. A prospective study of 115 women with endometriosis
found baseline catastrophizing (but not mental health or pain duration) was associated

1416

S. EVANS ET AL.

with decreased pelvic pain improvement (Martin et al., 2011). In a recent crosssectional study (n = 236), catastrophizing was associated with worse quality of life
(QoL), independently of psychological comorbidities and pelvic pain in women with
endometriosis. Consistent with our findings, only helplessness was a significant pre­
dictor of QoL (McPeak et al., 2018). Although these studies did not examine the role of
social support, together with our findings, evidence indicates that catastrophizing – and
in particular, feeling helpless – is a key psychological factor related to pain in menstrual
conditions.
The mechanisms underlying the relationship between pain catastrophizing and pain
experience have not been fully identified. Given that we found only helplessness was
associated with pain, it is possible that feeling powerless in the face of menstrual pain
represents a specific pathway for priming the brain to experience heightened pain. Recent
neural evidence has highlighted the importance of pain catastrophizing in top-down
processes in pain perception. Individuals high on pain catastrophizing tend to rate pain
based on predicted threat (rather than changes in sensory inputs), with associated
activation in brain areas associated with aversive learning (Lim et al., 2020).
Longitudinal studies in the context of menstrual pain are required to confirm causal
pathways.
There is likely a bidirectional relationship between catastrophizing and dysmenorrhea,
with catastrophizing a cause and a consequence of repeated exposure to menstrual pain.
Research has emphasised the negative impact of dysmenorrhea on biopsychosocial health
(Faramarzi & Salmalian, 2014; Schoep et al., 2019). Thus, repeated experience of men­
strual pain likely contributes to a focus on pain threat and feelings of helplessness.
Consistent with the biopsychosocial model (Engel, 1977), myriad factors may be involved
in why women with dysmenorrhea develop catastrophizing, including the wider culture,
which holds periods as taboo (Berkley & McAllister, 2011). Given that a diagnosis of
endometriosis takes up to 10 years – and even then, treatment is often elusive (Hudelist
et al., 2012), it is perhaps unsurprising that women with severe menstrual pain may feel
helpless. Literature documenting the experience of endometriosis also reveals that many
women are dismissed by their physicians as hysterical, or being hypochondrial about
‘normal’ menstruation (Whelan, 2007). A lack of adequate treatment, support, and
validation may leave women feeling helpless in the face of menstrual pain.
Interestingly, mental health was not significantly associated with dysmenorrhea.
Previous research has highlighted the roles of depression and anxiety in pain (Bajalan,
Moafi, MoradiBaglooei & Alimoradi, 2019). However, these studies have tended not to
include catastrophizing. On the basis of the present study, and others that have examined
catastrophizing along with mental health factors (Carey et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2011;
McPeak et al., 2018; Payne et al., 2016), it appears that catastrophizing is particularly
important. It is noteworthy that the psychosocial variables in this study together con­
tributed 22% and 18% of the variance in menstrual pain for PD and endometriosis
respectively, implying that psychosocial variables included here may also contribute to
menstrual pain in important ways. Pain catastrophizing may be a latent factor contribut­
ing to both distress and pain. Distress is related to helplessness, where the individual may
feel overwhelmed, that things are terrible and will not improve, and that they have few
resources to cope (Quartana et al., 2009). It is possible that co-morbid distress in

PSYCHOLOGY, HEALTH & MEDICINE

1417

dysmenorrhea is due to elevated pain catastrophizing cognitions in the form of help­
lessness around pain.
The current study failed to find a significant relationship between perceived social
support and pain severity. It is possible that cultural attitudes toward menstruation are
more important than an individual’s personal support network. One qualitative study
found that women commonly acted to comply with social cues that demanded the
concealment of menstruation, regardless of menstrual symptom severity (O’Flynn,
2006). Future research should examine the role of wider social forces, including social
taboos around menstruation in the experience of menstrual pain.
Our findings indicating a shared pattern of pain predictors (helplessness) for women
with dysmenorrhea regardless of etiology is consistent with prior research demonstrating
that pelvic abnormalities, such as in endometriosis may not result in a distinct symptom
profile. A study involving women with chronic pelvic pain (n = 656) found that the
severity of pelvic pain was similar in women with and without endometriosis lesions, and
independently associated with catastrophizing (Yosef et al., 2016). The current study
extends this finding, revealing a similar psychosocial profile for PD and endometriosis
even when including mental health and social support. The experience of menstrual pain,
rather than pathology, may be particularity important in dysmenorrhea (Evans et al.,
2018). It is possible that the combination of cyclical menstrual pain with feeling helpless
acts as a precursor to the development of neural pain pathways shared by women with
pelvic pain regardless of diagnosis (As-Sanie et al., 2012). However, it is worth noting that
women with endometriosis reported significantly longer duration of pain, and higher
pain and catastrophizing in the present study, suggesting that menstrual pain may be
experienced as more severe and disabling in endometriosis.
Limitations of the study include its cross-sectional design not allowing causal infer­
ences. The reliance on self-report measures and lack of clinical measures means some
women reporting PD may actually have endometriosis. Likewise, confirmation of endo­
metriosis was not possible. The use of a community sample may limit the generalisability
of findings, however, prior research suggests that sociodemographic and QoL profiles are
similar in women with endometriosis recruited through support networks compared to
tertiary care centres (De Graaff et al., 2015), suggesting our results may extend to tertiary
clinic patients.

Conclusions
Pain helplessness relates to pain experience in dysmenorrhea, regardless of etiology.
Targeting helplessness may be an important preventive and treatment goal for dysme­
norrhea. Psychological and mind-body interventions are worth investigating, including
cognitive behavior therapy, which targets maladaptive thoughts related to catastrophiz­
ing and mind-body interventions, which have been found to reduce pelvic pain
catastrophizing (Payne et al., 2020). Although such interventions are promising, largescale research is required to understand their efficacy and whether their mechanism of
action involves reduced pain helplessness. Further research is also required to under­
stand the origins of menstrual pain helplessness, including the roles of healthcare
professionals and wider societal norms in adequately supporting women with men­
strual pain.
