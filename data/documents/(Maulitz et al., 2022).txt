Comorbid mental disorders

Endometriosis is a chronic pain disorder that affects young women, impairing their physical, mental and social
well-being. Apart from personal suffering, it imposes a significant economic burden on the healthcare system.
We analyzed studies reporting comorbid mental disorders in endometriosis based on the ICD/DSM criteria,
discussing them in the context of available neuroimaging studies.
We postulate that at least one-third of endometriosis patients suffer from mental disorders (mostly depression
or anxiety) and require psychiatric or psychotherapeutic support. According to three neuroimaging studies
involving patients with endometriosis, brain regions related not only to pain processing but also to emotion,
cognition, self-regulation and reward likely constitute the so-called “endometriosis brain”. It is not clear, how­
ever, whether the neurobiological changes seen in these patients are caused by chronic pain, mental comor­
bidities or endometriosis itself.
Given the paucity of high-quality data on mental comorbidities and neurobiological correlates in endome­
triosis, further research is needed.

1. Introduction
Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by
lesions of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus. The leading
symptoms of the condition, which has the potential to result in infertility
(Siedentopf & Sillem, 2014; World Health Organization, 2020), are
chronic pelvic pain (CPP), painful menstruation or intercourse, and
painful or difficult urination or defecation. Long seen as a local disease
(Benagiano & Brosens, 1991), its treatment has been limited to the
surgical removal of the lesions. Increasingly, the combined treatment of
laparoscopic removal of endometriosis followed by three- to six-month
endocrine therapy is found to yield the highest response rates (Mettler
et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the majority of patients require longer-term
treatment to control the persistent pain symptoms, which reoccur after
discontinuation of endocrine therapy (Vercellini et al., 2003). Irre­
spective of the treatment approach, however, over 50% of women suffer

a recurrence of the disease over a period of 5 years (Zondervan et al.,
2020). The fact of frequent symptom recurrence after (repeated) surgical
therapy, and the current advances in the disease pathophysiology and
neuroscience have led to the general acceptance of endometriosis as a
systemic disease, involving not only local changes but also those in the
endocrine and central nervous systems (Bulun et al., 2019; Zondervan
et al., 2020). Given the problems of CPP, infertility, and lack of satis­
faction with the quality of life, women suffering from endometriosis
constitute a high burden of psychosocial load, often resulting in mental
disorders with varying degrees of severity.
1.1. Prevalence and pathophysiological mechanisms
Increasingly understood as a result of complex interactions of
immunological, genetic, hormonal and environmental factors (Toth,
2010; Bulun et al., 2019; Zondervan et al., 2020), endometriosis is

among the most frequent non-malignant diseases in women of child­
bearing age (Eskenazi & Warner, 1997), affecting about 10% of all
reproductive-age women (Shafrir et al., 2018). However, the true
prevalence of the disease may be underestimated as the percentage of
women who have endometriosis but are asymptomatic is unknown. That
means that our knowledge of population distributions, disease mani­
festations, and risk factors of endometriosis is limited to the data
involving women in whom endometriosis is a) clinically manifested
(usually via pain and/or infertility) and b) successfully diagnosed via
surgical visualization and histological examination of the removed
endometriotic lesions (Zondervan et al., 2020).
The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to the establishment of
ectopic endometrium lesions outside the uterus, as a histopathological
substrate for endometriosis, have yet to be elucidated. The most
frequently cited theory, and the one most supported by evidence thus
far, is Sampson’s theory of transplantation and implantation (Sampson,
1927), which suggests that endometriosis implants originate from
eutopic endometrium alighting in the abdominal cavity during retro­
grade menstruation (Zondervan et al., 2020; Bulun et al., 2019). How­
ever, given that retrograde menstruation is common, affecting up to
76–90% of menstruating women (Blumenkrantz et al., 1981; Carpinello
et al., 2021), there must be other factors that enable endometrial cells to
adhere to peritoneal surfaces, survive, proliferate, and develop into
endometriotic lesions. Increased production of estrogens, cytokines,
prostaglandins, and metalloproteinases, local progesterone resistance,
enhanced angiogenesis and immune dysfunction have been demon­
strated to facilitate the survival and proliferation of the ectopic endo­
metrial tissue (Bulun et al., 2019).

synapses, resulting in accelerated conduction along the nerve fibers
(Zheng et al., 2019). Additionally, the persistent nociceptive input may
increase the responsiveness of the dorsal horn neurons, and the pro­
cessing signals from the visceral and somatic tissues, leading to a
reduction of the pain threshold and exaggeration of pain perception
(Bajaj et al., 2003). More salient pain signals are conveyed to the thal­
amus where they are further processed with respect to their sensory and
affective qualities. Notably, brain changes in patients with chronic pain
are not limited to the nociceptive pathways; they also involve the
mesocorticolimbic circuitry, which is primarily linked to motivation,
reward, aversion and learning processes (Barroso et al., 2021). The
involved brain regions, like the anterior cingulate cortex, the medial
prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the amygdala, are thought to modulate the
affective features of pain signals. Additionally, the hippocampus, clas­
sically associated with memory and learning processes, has also been
demonstrated to undergo structural and functional changes, possibly
due to pain-related memories with continual reinforcement and
learning, which is caused by the constant presence of pain. In patients
with chronic pain, these regions are functionally reorganized to acquire
this abnormal network state, resulting in pain chronization (Apkarian
et al., 2009; Barroso et al., 2021). These processes contribute to the
generation of more intense pain memories in the cerebral cortex, exac­
erbating future experience of pain (Zondervan et al., 2020) and resulting
in central sensitization. The fact that these processes are independent of
the type of the disease and its stage of progression may be a partial
explanation of the poor correlation between the severity of endometri­
osis and its clinical symptoms. It may be central sensitization (Berkley
et al., 2005) that makes the sensation of pain in endometriosis extend
beyond the endometriotic lesions, rendering patients highly susceptible
to cross-organ sensitization (pain perception in adjacent structures due
to the convergence of neural pathways) and causing inadequate pain
relief in many cases even after a complete excision of the endometriosis
loci (Zondervan et al., 2020).

1.2. From the ectopic endometrial tissue to memories of pain in the
cerebral cortex
In women with endometriosis, the severity of the symptoms corre­
lates poorly with the extent of the disease. While women with a small
number of lesions and few adhesions may suffer severe pain or infer­
tility, or both, those with more lesions and/or endometrioma, along with
extensive adhesions, may be asymptomatic (Zondervan et al., 2020).
The reason behind that, and the persistent pain even after the removal of
endometriotic lesions, is that pelvic pain may be both inflammatory and
neuropathic in nature (Carey et al., 2017), both (particularly the latter)
being characterized by potential sensitization of the central nervous
system (Laux-Biehlmann et al., 2015), which is also thought to be the
case in other chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia or chronic
spinal pain (Malfliet et al., 2018; Petzke et al., 2003).
The complex endocrine and proinflammatory microenvironment in
and around the endometriosis lesions promotes their proliferation,
vascularization and nociception (Laux-Biehlmann, 2015). The
endometrium-like tissues release a number of inflammatory proteins
and chemokines, which induce leukocyte activation and macrophage
recruitment, subsequently stimulating neuroangiogenesis in the endo­
metriosis lesions. The nerve fiber density in the lesions is associated with
pain severity, which can be reduced by hormonal therapies, providing
one of the possible mechanisms for the pain relief experienced during
hormonal treatment (Asante & Taylor, 2011). The nerve fibers within
endometriotic lesions (Berkley et al., 2005) are permanently stimulated
by inflammatory mediators and nerve-sensitizing proteins, which are
released by noxious stimuli into the sensory afferent nerve at the lesion’s
distal end with the nociceptive signal being transferred to the nerve root
of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (Laux-Biehlmann, 2015). Moreover,
nociceptive channels, including a number of neuropeptides playing a
key role in generating hyperalgesic responses, have been seen to be
overexpressed in endometriosis lesions (Saunders & Horne, 2021). The
pain signal is conveyed to the thalamus, the brain stem and the cerebral
cortex (Bulun et al., 2019; Laux-Biehlmann et al., 2015; Zondervan
et al., 2020). This persistent stimulation of the lesion sites by the in­
flammatory factors induces a structural remodeling of the peripheral

1.3. From chronic pain to multifactorial burden
The clinical symptoms of endometriosis include not only chronic
pain but also fatigue and infertility, affecting the physical, mental,
sexual and social well-being of women with symptomatic endometriosis
(Gallagher et al., 2018; Nnoaham et al., 2019; Rush et al., 2019; Zon­
dervan et al., 2020). Not being able to sustain or regularly attend fulltime work due to the symptoms of endometriosis, women frequently
develop feelings of guilt. Also, the fear of stigmatization involving
menstruation-related symptoms (Matasariu et al., 2017) keeps women
from talking about the disease (Rush & Misajon, 2018), thus depriving
them of the necessary social support. Women suffering from dyspar­
eunia (painful intercourse) due to endometriosis demonstrate decreased
sexual activity, self-esteem and sexual satisfaction (Brandes, 2007; De
Graaff et al., 2016; Zondervan et al., 2020). Frequently, they also
develop negative thoughts about intercourse and avoid sexual activity
(Fritzer et al., 2013). The inability to conceive, or concerns about po­
tential infertility, can further exacerbate the psychological distress.
Collectively, these factors can seriously affect relationships (Shum et al.,
2018), in some cases leading to their termination (Fagervold et al.,
2009). At the same time, many women assume that their pain is normal
and not pathological (Markovic et al., 2008), which is indirectly
endorsed by their general practitioners and even gynecologists, who do
not acknowledge the severity of the pain symptoms. All this often leads
to a lengthy interval, ranging between seven and twelve years depend­
ing on the country, between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis
(Fritzer et al., 2012; Ghai et al., 2019; Hadfield et al., 1996). This
diagnostic delay and the ensuing lack of timely treatment likely affect
the course of the disease, resulting in the persistence of the pain symp­
toms. Stress levels (Lazzeri et al., 2015) and perceived psychological
impairment (Eriksen et al., 2008) increase with pain severity, putting
women with endometriosis in a vicious cycle of pain, chronic distress,

physical inactivity and consequent physical deconditioning, and
depressive mood and anxiety, each reinforcing the other (Petrelluzzi
et al., 2012).

et al., 2013; Charpidou, 2014; De Graaff et al., 2016; Facchin et al.,
2017; Laganà et al., 2018; Luisi et al., 2015; Muchanga et al., 2017;
Peres et al., 2017; Tagliaferri et al., 2020). However, most of the
available studies on psychopathological comorbidities of patients with
endometriosis are based on patients’ self-reported data and question­
naires (e.g. Ek et al., 2018; Facchin et al., 2015; Laganà et al., 2015),
which leave a lot of room for misinterpretation or misunderstanding of
items by the patients and cannot capture an individual’s particular
context and situation around possible symptoms (Pettersson et al., 2015;
Saez-Flores et al., 2018; Serra et al., 2017). Thus, the prevalence rates of
mental disorders in patients with endometriosis are likely to have been
overestimated by the studies relying only on questionnaires and selfreporting outcomes (Levis et al., 2019). As a consequence, it is diffi­
cult to determine which percentage of women with endometriosis who
report increased anxiety or depressive symptoms really meet the diag­
nostic criteria (e.g. Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor­
ders (DSM) or International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems (ICD)) for psychiatric disorders and require
relevant treatment.
In addition, chronic pain, which is the leading symptom of endo­
metriosis, can induce new mental disorders or aggravate preexisting
ones (Pope et al., 2015; Roth et al., 2011). According to several metaanalyses, pain as well as depressive and bipolar disorders cause changes
in regional brain morphology and functional connectivity (Coppieters
et al., 2016; Iwabuchi et al., 2015; Kaiser et al., 2015; Schmaal et al.,
2017; Smallwood et al., 2013; Wise et al., 2017). Given that, in addition
to chronic pain, many women with endometriosis suffer from comorbid
mental disorders, they likely undergo structural and functional changes
in the brain. However, the exact extent of research in this field is un­
clear, having never been reviewed before, particularly in relation to
psychiatric comorbidities. In the present review, we have sought to
analyze the available data on the prevalence of common mental disor­
ders among women with endometriosis based only on studies in which
the diagnosis of mental disorders was objectively confirmed according
to the ICD (World Health Organization, 2020) or the DSM (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013) criteria. While self-reported question­
naire-based diagnostics of mental disorders has been demonstrated to
have a high sensitivity, its specificity in comparison to a diagnostic
interview is relatively low with a considerable probability of over­
estimation of the psychiatric symptoms (Thombs et al., 2018). While
most other reviews have dealt with one psychiatric problem potentially
associated with endometriosis (e.g. bipolar disorders or depression/
anxiety) (Aerts et al., 2018; Dinsdale & Crespi, 2017; Gambadauro et al.,
2019; Halis et al., 2010; Vitale et al., 2009), our aim has been to provide
a complete overview of the available evidence of psychiatric disorders
across a number of diseases. Additionally, based on a literature search,
we have summarized studies focused on the alterations in brain struc­
ture and resting-state connectivity in women with endometriosis. In
addition to assessing the number of such studies, the number of patients
included in them has also been taken into account in order to draw
parallels between findings in endometriosis patients and alterations
specific to patients with mental disorders like depression, anxiety and
bipolar disorders, as well as those with chronic pain. We have sought to
determine the extent to which it may be possible to postulate, based on
these studies, whether the observed changes in brain structure or con­
nectivity are specific to the endometriosis brain or if they just reflect
coexisting mental comorbidities or pain conditions. Finally, based on
our review of the literature, we discuss potential trajectories for future
research as well as the gaps in our current understanding of endome­
triosis, and how new research strategies including up-to-date neuro­
imaging techniques and investigation of pain processing in the context
of psychiatric comorbidities can help close those gaps.

1.4. Preexisting factors increase the vulnerability
Given that adolescence and young adulthood is when the onset of
endometriosis-associated pain symptoms is most often reported, the
initial pathophysiological phases of endometriosis likely occur earlier in
life (Zondervan et al., 2020). Interestingly, early stressful life events
such as physical and sexual abuse during childhood and later in life,
which are well-known risk factors for depression and anxiety disorders
(Bernet & Stein, 1999; Spila et al., 2005), are also associated with an
increased risk of endometriosis (Harris et al., 2018). There is some ev­
idence that sexual and emotional abuse may have a greater influence on
the development of endometriosis symptoms than physical maltreat­
ment (Liebermann et al., 2018). Early psychological trauma is thought
to cause persistent central pain sensitization with an enhancement of the
nociceptive neuronal pathways via reduced inhibition, increased syn­
aptic efficacy and membrane excitability (Woolf, 2011). Besides, expo­
sure to stressful life events has been shown to cause changes in cortisol
levels (Fries et al., 2005; Heim et al., 2000), in turn facilitating a sec­
ondary hypocortisolism, leading to an altered inflammation response
and contributing to the development of endometriosis. In line with this
hypothesis, women with endometriosis have been found to have lower
levels of cortisol (Petrelluzzi et al., 2012). In addition, the early onset of
pain symptoms in women with endometriosis, e.g. in adolescence (with
the onset of menarche), likely affects the central nervous system, given
its plasticity, leading to changes in brain structure (Brawn et al., 2014).
There are other developmental and physiological factors, including an
early menarche, shorter cycle, longer menstruation (factors increasing
exposure to retrograde menstruation) as well as low birth weight and
lower body-mass index (Eskenazi & Warner, 1997; Liu & Zhang, 2017;
Shafrir et al., 2018; Zondervan et al., 2020), that have been found to be
associated with an increased risk for endometriosis.
Personality traits also appear to influence the outcome of patients
with endometriosis. For instance, patients with neurotic personality
traits are more prone to developing chronic pain conditions, which can
contribute to the development of symptomatic endometriosis (Charpi­
dou, 2014). However, changes in personality traits can also occur sec­
ondary to the development of the symptoms of endometriosis. Women
with painful endometriosis, for example, have been found to have lower
levels of novelty seeking, higher harm avoidance and lower exploratory
excitability and responsibility along with lower self-directedness
compared to controls (Facchin et al., 2017). Moreover, patients with
endometriosis are prone to pain catastrophizing (a negative cognitiveaffective response to anticipated or actual pain). Their fear of pain and
hypervigilance with respect to pain characteristics (van Aken et al.,
2017) lead to a further increased perception of pain severity (Allaire
et al., 2018). Thus, in addition to such factors as inflammation or al­
terations in pain processing, there are several biopsychosocial risk fac­
tors associated with the development of endometriosis and its complex
symptomatology. It is difficult to determine whether these associations
play a causal role in endometriosis, or whether they are consequences of
the condition, due to our limited understanding of the disorder’s initi­
ation and development and the inability to diagnose it before symptom
onset (Zondervan et al., 2020).
1.5. From multifactorial burden to psychiatric disorder and the
endometriosis brain
Given the complex psychosocial burden of endometriosis, it is not
surprising that several studies have found women with endometriosis to
report depressive and anxiety symptoms more often, the relationship
having also been observed in other chronic pain conditions like fibro­
myalgia, chronic lower back pain, migraine and myofascial pain (Bernik

with endometriosis, the PubMed, PSYNDEX and Web of Science data­
bases were searched for publications focusing on endometriosis in
combination with confirmed diagnoses of mental disorders. To ensure
the results’ contemporaneity, the search was confined to papers pub­
lished between January 2010 and June 2020. Studies were included in
the analysis only if the mental disorder discussed therein had been
diagnosed by trained clinicians, psychotherapists or psychiatrists ac­
cording to the ICD (World Health Organization, 2020) or DSM (Amer­
ican Psychiatric Association, 2013) criteria and on the basis of clinical
interviews or Structural Clinical Interviews for DSM (SCID) (First et al.,
2016), or had been documented in clinical medical records and national
health databases.
The search for mental disorders was performed using the following
terms: endometriosis AND diagnos* or confirmed combined with the
mental disorders depress*, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, eating dis­
orders, alcohol and drug dependence disorders, personality disorders, autism
spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and psychotic
disorders.
After identification of the data of potential interest, duplicates,
publications with wrong topic and animal or qualitative studies (e.g.
analyzing interview data or case reports), reviews and meta-analyses
were discarded. The remaining studies were reviewed to ensure
confirmed diagnoses of mental disorders in combination with endome­
triosis, with surveys pertaining to self-reporting and questionnairebased psychological or psychiatric symptoms being excluded. Several
studies met multiple exclusion criteria and were counted for each
exclusion criterion. A few studies were found to involve several mental
disorders, meeting the inclusion criteria. Articles that fulfilled the pre­
defined inclusion criteria were included in the full-text analysis.
The database search for the neuroimaging data involved studies on
voxel-based morphometry and functional resting-state connectivity in
patients with endometriosis. To select publications on brain structure
alterations in patients with endometriosis, the keywords neuroimaging
OR MRI brain* OR magnetic resonance imaging brain* OR brain imaging*
AND endometriosis were used to search the PubMed, PSYNDEX and Web
of Science databases. Here too, we excluded duplicates, papers with
wrong topic, animal studies, reviews and meta-analyses and considered
the remaining studies for full-text analysis. To remove any possible bias
introduced by the file-drawer effect, we also performed a search for
unpublished studies, which constitute what is known as “gray litera­
ture”, in Google Scholar using the above-mentioned key words (Tincani
& Trevors, 2019). Given that no relevant papers could be identified, the
probability of such a bias is estimated to be low.

3.1. Major depression
The database search for major depression resulted in 168 articles, of
which 47 were duplicates, 100 papers had the wrong topic, three were
animal studies and 18 were reviews or meta-analyses. After excluding
articles due to other exclusion criteria (see Fig. 1), nine studies remained
for the full-text analysis. The screening process is depicted in Fig. 1.

3.2. Anxiety disorders

3.4. Other mental disorders

The search for papers on anxiety disorders yielded 31 publications,
seven of which were duplicates, nine had a wrong topic and two were
animal studies, leaving four studies for full-text analysis. Fig. 2 depicts
the screening process.

The search for other mental disorders, except autism spectrum dis­
order, resulted only in the study by Gao et al. (2020), which was
included in the analysis. Surprisingly, no article from the literature
search could be considered for autism spectrum disorder despite Gao
et al. (2020) reporting on that mental disorder. An overview of the
screening process is summarized in Table 1.

3.3. Bipolar disorder
As depicted in Fig. 3, the database search for bipolar disorders and
endometriosis resulted in eight papers. Three of them were duplicates
and two were reviews, leaving three studies for the full-text analysis.

characterized by ectopic endometrial tissue within the uterine myome­
trium. The remaining studies did not report on specific localization and
stages of the disease. In two studies, healthy controls were considered to
not have endometriosis if they did not have symptoms, sonographic
signs or history of surgery because of endometriosis (Cavaggioni et al.,
2014; Greenbaum et al., 2019). In two other studies, endometriosis and
adenomyosis were ruled out via diagnostic laparoscopy (Kumar et al.,
2011; Taran et al., 2010). Only two studies reported on hormonal
therapy for endometriosis (Chen et al., 2020; Smorgick et al., 2013).

Taken together, our search resulted in 232 papers, which were
further screened for eligibility. Nine studies describing an association
between endometriosis and comorbid mental disorders were available
for the full-text analysis. A few studies, involving disparate methodo­
logical approaches, reported on several comorbid mental disorders in
patients with endometriosis (e.g. Gao et al., 2020).
Three studies on comorbid mental disorders among patients with
endometriosis were conducted in Europe (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Gao
et al., 2020; Warzecha et al., 2020), three in USA (Kumar et al., 2011;
Smorgick et al., 2013; Taran et al., 2010), two in Taiwan (Chen et al.,
2020; Chiang et al., 2018) and one in Israel (Greenbaum et al., 2019).
Five studies analyzed data retrospectively (Chiang et al., 2018; Gao
et al., 2020; Greenbaum et al., 2019; Smorgick et al., 2013; Taran et al.,
2010) and four prospectively (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2020;
Kumar et al., 2011; Warzecha et al., 2020). Six of the studies were cohort
studies (Chen et al., 2020; Chiang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2020;
Greenbaum et al., 2019; Smorgick et al., 2013; Warzecha et al., 2020),
while two were case-control studies (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Taran
et al., 2010) and one a cross-sectional study (Kumar et al., 2011). Five
studies retrieved their data from local clinical records like hospitals or
departments for gynaecology (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Kumar et al.,
2011; Smorgick et al., 2013; Taran et al., 2010; Warzecha et al., 2020)
whereas four studies used data from national databases on health in­
surance and national registers (Chen et al., 2020; Chiang et al., 2018;
Gao et al., 2020; Greenbaum et al., 2019). Endometriosis was confirmed
by surgery in four studies (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2011;
Smorgick et al., 2013; Taran et al., 2010), of which two used verified
diagnosis by histopathological examination (Cavaggioni et al., 2014;
Taran et al., 2010). Two studies included endometriosis patients based
on ultrasonography data (Chen et al., 2020; Warzecha et al., 2020) with
the one by Warzecha et al. (2020) also relying on previous surgical
confirmation. Another three studies relied on medical records without
reporting further information (Chiang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2020;
Greenbaum et al., 2019). Five studies reported mental disorders based
on medical records documented by trained physicians or psychiatrists
(Chiang et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2020; Smorgick et al., 2013; Taran et al.,
2010; Warzecha et al., 2020), one referred to the diagnosis made by
board-certified psychiatrists (Chen et al., 2020) and two other studies
used the SCID to assess comorbid mental disorders (Cavaggioni et al.,
2014; Kumar et al., 2011). Six studies had a two-armed design, with four
of them comparing endometriosis patients with women without endo­
metriosis (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2020; Gao et al., 2020;
Greenbaum et al., 2019) and, in two studies, also with patients with
another condition, like uterus fibroids or CPP unrelated to endometriosis
(Kumar et al., 2011; Taran et al., 2010). One study had a three-armed
design comparing endometriosis and fibromyalgia patients with con­
trols suffering from neither condition (Greenbaum et al., 2019).
Two studies reported on the extent of endometriosis according to the
revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine (rASRM) classification
(Smorgick et al., 2013; Warzecha et al., 2020), while one reported on the
localization of endometriosis lesions (Cavaggioni et al., 2014) and one
focused explicitly on adenomyosis (Taran et al., 2010), which is

3.6. Study population and mental disorder comorbidities
In total, the nine eligible studies included 268,734 patients with
endometriosis and 1,639,072 women without endometriosis. Of these
nine studies, the biggest ones, with 91% of the overall endometriosis
population, were the cohort studies of Gao et al. (2020) and Chiang et al.
(2018), which were based on national health-related databases.
Only one study described patients with endometriosis in more detail,
discriminating between those with symptomatic (183 participants) and
asymptomatic (56 participants) endometriosis (Warzecha et al., 2020).
Out of the 1,639,072 control participants in all studies, additional in­
formation was available only with respect to 207 women, of whom 43
were reported to be healthy (Cavaggioni et al., 2014), unaffected by
CPP, while 12 suffered from endometriosis-independent CPP (Kumar
et al., 2011) and 152 had uterus fibroids (Taran et al., 2010). For the
remaining control participants, no further details were available.
An overview of all analyzed studies is shown in Table 2.
As Fig. 4 shows, the range of selected mental disorder prevalence
rates in endometriosis patients is quite broad according to the studies
reviewed here (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2020; Greenbaum
et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2011; Smorgick et al., 2013; Taran et al., 2010;
Warzecha et al., 2020). The major depressive disorder (MDD) rates
demonstrate the widest distribution from 1.36% to 55.3% (Chiang et al.,
2018; Taran et al., 2010) with the rates of anxiety disorders ranging
from 3.7% to 29.7% (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Kumar et al., 2011) and
those of bipolar disorders from 0.85% to 44.44% (Chen et al., 2020;
Kumar et al., 2011). Only one study reported on the prevalence of other
mental disorders in patients with endometriosis, like eating disorders
(2.96%), alcohol/drug dependence disorders (3.56%), personality dis­
orders (4.86%), autism spectrum disorder (0.93%), attention-deficit
disorder (4.07%) and non-affective psychotic disorders (0.87%) (Gao
et al., 2020).
3.7. Neuroimaging and endometriosis
The database search with the afore-mentioned keywords (see section
2) resulted in 52 hits for neuroimaging and endometriosis (Fig. 5). Nine
of them were duplicates, 28 had a wrong topic, three described animal
studies, one was a qualitative study and seven were reviews, leaving
three articles for the full-text analysis.

Higher prevalence of depressive disorders, anxiety disorders and bipolar disorders among patients with
endometriosis (17.37%, 24.21% and 3.43%, respectively) as compared to the controls (9.14%, 12.91% and

HRs before endometriosis diagnosis were for depressive disorders HR = 1.81 (95 %CI: 1.71–1.92), anxiety
disorders HR = 1.94 (95 %CI: 1.84–2.04) and bipolar disorders HR = 1.64 (95 %CI: 1.44–1.86).
HRs after endometriosis diagnosis were for depressive disorders HR = 1.89 (95 %CI: 1.78–2.01), anxiety
disorders HR = 1.82 (95 %CI: 1.73–1.92) and bipolar disorders HR = 1.62 (95 %CI: 1.43–1.83).
Prevalence of depression and/or anxiety was higher among patients with endometriosis alone (39.5%),
fibromyalgia alone (62.3%) and endometriosis & fibromyalgia (63.1%) as compared to the controls
(29.1%), d = 0.72.
Compared to CPP patients, women with endometriosis suffered more often from bipolar disorder (0 vs.

dysmenorrhea, were used as comparators in both studies.
The third trial was a prospective, interventional two-armed ran­
domized controlled study (Beissner et al., 2018), in which 67 patients
with severe endometriosis-associated pain were randomly allocated to
intervention (35 patients) or waitlist control (32 patients) groups.
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to
assess brain connectivity of these patients at baseline, after 3 months of
therapy, and after 6 months. The intervention included psychotherapy
(with elements of mindfulness-based psychotherapy, hypnotherapy,
problem-solving therapy, and cognitive–behavioral therapy) with so­
matosensory stimulation by means of traditional Chinese techniques
(acupuncture, moxibustion (heat), and cupping). The stage of endome­
triosis was also reported according to the rASRM.
3.9. Results of neuroimaging studies
Compared to healthy controls, women with symptomatic endome­
triosis showed decreased gray matter volume in the left thalamus, the
left middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the left and right midcingulate cortices
(MCC), the right putamen and the right insula and increased gray matter
volume in the left amygdala (As-sanie et al., 2012; Fig. 6). In contrast,
asymptomatic endometriosis patients had increased gray matter volume
in the right periaqueductal gray (PAG), the right inferior frontal gyrus
(IFG) and the right MFG and gray matter volume decreases in the right
inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) as compared to healthy controls (Fig. 6).
Additionally, symptomatic endometriosis patients demonstrated an
increased resting-state connectivity between the anterior insula and the
left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), the left mPFC and the left oc­
cipital cortex compared to their healthy counterparts, whereas asymp­
tomatic patients did not differ in resting-state connectivity from the
healthy controls (As-Sanie et al., 2016; Fig. 7). Patients with
endometriosis-independent CPP showed a gray matter volume decrease
in the left thalamus as compared to healthy controls.
The study by Beissner et al. (2018) demonstrated a reduction in the
number of symptoms in women with endometriosis following psycho­
therapy with somatosensory stimulation. In comparison with wait-list
controls, treated patients showed improvements with respect to pelvic

etry and endometriosis included 17 women with symptomatic
endometriosis, 13 with asymptomatic endometriosis, 6 with CPP of
other origin and 26 healthy controls. The trial on functional resting-state

with CPP and 11 more healthy controls. Endometriosis was surgically
confirmed in all patients and the disease stage was determined accord­
ing to the rASRM. Healthy women, who did not have chronic pain or

the questionnaires and physical and mental quality of life after three
months. These changes were associated with a decrease in the connec­
tivity between the anterior hippocampus and both the primary and the
right secondary somatosensory cortices (SSC), the supramarginal gyrus
(SMG), the posterior MCC, the right frontoinsular cortex (FIC), the
temporal pole, the anterior insula and the mPFC. Regression analysis
showed that the reduction in connectivity had predicted the therapyinduced improvement in patients’ anxiety.

4. Discussion
Patients with symptomatic endometriosis often suffer from the con­
dition and, as a result, poor quality of life for years before being diag­
nosed with endometriosis (Zondervan et al., 2020). The negative effects
of the disorder accumulate further after the diagnosis with frequent
symptom recurrence following (repeated) surgery. Not surprisingly,
women affected by endometriosis are susceptible to a number of psy­
chosocial risk factors (and vice versa), which lead to the development of
mental disorders across the patients’ lifespan. Based on the nine studies
included in this review, we can conclude that, in women with endo­
metriosis, there is a high prevalence of depression and anxiety disorders,
bipolar disorder (Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2020; Greenbaum
et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2011), and, in some cases, increased alcohol/
drug dependence (3.56% in endometriosis patients (Gao et al., 2020) vs.
1.25% (95 %CI: 1.13–1.4) as well as attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (4.07% in endometriosis patients (Gao et al., 2020) vs. 0.62%
(95 %CI: 0.45–0.83) in the female world population (The Institute for
Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2019). In women suffering from symp­
tomatic endometriosis, a number of factors contribute to the increased
prevalence of psychiatric problems with the most important of them
being pain and additional somatic comorbidities, like fibromyalgia,
interstitial cystitis, migraine, chronic fatigue syndrome that frequently
co-occur with endometriosis (Boneva et al., 2019; Greenbaum et al.,
2019). Hormonal treatments, inflammation or genetic predisposition are
also addressed here as they seem to play an important role in the
development of mental disorders. Furthermore, we have summarized
the available data on the alterations of brain structure and functional
connectivity seen in patients with endometriosis.
4.1. Comorbidities among patients with endometriosis
Despite more than 50 reports on the possible association of endo­
metriosis with depressive and anxiety symptoms, only nine studies were
found to involve objectively confirmed diagnoses of mental disorder
and, therefore, were included in this review. As expected, the prevalence
of confirmed depression or anxiety disorders as a comorbidity of endo­
metriosis, with a median of 17.37% and 23.61%, respectively, was found
to be lower than that derived from studies based only on self-reported
outcomes (about 40–50% and 55%, respectively) (Donatti et al., 2017;
Márki et al., 2017; Roomaney et al., 2020). However, the frequency of
mental disorders (even after excluding the results based only on selfreported assessments) considerably exceeded the prevalence of these
conditions both in the healthy controls of the reviewed studies and the
general female population (Fig. 4). The prevalence rate of bipolar dis­
order was roughly six times higher than in the female world population,
and that of depression and anxiety more than twice as high. Given a high
coincidence of mental disorders, like depressive and anxiety disorder, of
about 38–63%, (Wittchen, 2002), we can assume that at least one-third
of endometriosis patients seem to have a mental disorder and, therefore,
require professional psychiatric or psychotherapeutic assistance.
Undoubtedly, the prevalence of mental disorders is influenced by
specific cultural and socio-economic factors, which can also be respon­
sible for the large variation in the prevalence of mental disorders be­
tween different national populations of endometriosis patients. For
instance, Taiwanese patients with endometriosis showed the lowest

prevalence of depression (1.36%) with the prevalence of MDD in general
being quite low (1.20%) in Taiwan (Chiang et al., 2018; Liao et al.,
2012). It has been suggested that the structured diagnostic interviews
designed in the West fail to elicit information regarding the symptoms of
depression from Asian patients, who tend to repress their emotions
owing to what is often referred to as “oriental stoicism”. This culturally
determined “response bias” likely skews such instruments toward a
lower estimate of the prevalence of depressive disorders among Asian
populations (Liao et al., 2012). Using screening instruments particularly
adapted to Taiwanese populations, recent studies have found a much
higher prevalence of depression in Taiwanese adults (above 10%) (Tai
et al., 2014). Contrary to the study by Chiang et al. (2018), the one by
Greenbaum et al. (2019) found an extremely high prevalence of
depression or anxiety (29.1% depression and/or anxiety) in Israel. In
this study, the presence of endometriosis was found to increase the
prevalence of mental disorders up to 39.5%, and even further (up to
63%) if fibromyalgia co-occurred with endometriosis. However, women
with fibromyalgia without endometriosis also demonstrated similar
rates of depression and/or anxiety (up to 62.3%). It can be assumed,
therefore, that specific cultural factors, somatic comorbidities or other
pain conditions co-occurring with endometriosis are linked to higher
rates of depression or anxiety. The study by Taran et al. (2010) found
that more than one-half of patients with adenomyosis (with and without

other manifestations of endometriosis) had a history of depression
compared to approximately one-quarter of those with uterus fibroids
(52.6% vs. 22.2%), and were also more likely to be susceptible to
infertility and pelvic pain. Finally, Gao et al. (2020) demonstrated that,
after adjustment for birth characteristics and education, women with
endometriosis had a higher risk of being subsequently diagnosed not
only with depressive or anxiety disorders but also with alcohol/drug
dependence and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.
Interestingly, it is not only the comorbidity but also the experience of
pain itself that is thought to be associated with an increased prevalence
of mental disorders. According to a recent meta-analysis (Gambadauro
et al., 2019), the link between endometriosis and depressive symptoms
is largely determined by chronic pain, with no significant difference in
prevalence of depression being found between women with pelvic pain
and endometriosis and those with pelvic pain but without endometriosis
(de Carvalho et al., 2015; Warzecha et al., 2020). A study by Warzecha
et al. (2020) demonstrated that it is not only the severity of pain but also
its type that can influence the prevalence of mental disorders. While
patients with chronic pelvic pain and dyschezia are more likely to
develop a depressive disorder, conditions such as dysuria, dyspareunia
or dysmenorrhea do not seem to increase the prevalence of mental
comorbidities. Also, asymptomatic patients with endometriosis have
been found to be much less prone to depressive or anxiety disorders than

women with pain symptoms (As-sanie et al., 2012; Cavaggioni et al.,
2014; Facchin et al., 2015; Gambassi, 2009; Pope et al., 2015). However,
the data on the prevalence of mental disorders in asymptomatic patients
with endometriosis are limited to the studies using self-reporting out­
comes and, therefore, need to be reproduced using objective diagnostic
methods. It is not yet possible to ascertain the extent to which pain in­
creases the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in women diagnosed with
endometriosis; more studies are needed therefore to address this ques­
tion. It may not only be pain alone but individual and context-specific
vulnerabilities (Gambadauro et al., 2019), including pain-coping stra­
tegies (Donatti et al., 2017) and hormonal treatment, may also
contribute to the development or aggravation of mood disorders. For
instance, As-sanie et al. (2012) found increased PAG gray matter volume
in women with asymptomatic endometriosis compared to healthy con­
trols. It is possible that those alterations were either related to initially
high pain thresholds (e.g. lower predisposition to the development of
pain sensation) of the affected patients, explaining the asymptomatic
course of the disease, or were caused secondarily by the pain processing
system adapting to the noxious stimuli (As-sanie et al., 2012). It must be
noted that depression is a frequent side effect of hormone therapy,
which is more of a rule than an exception in endometriosis, typically
with progestogen-only methods as first-line therapy (Gambassi, 2009;
Gao et al., 2020; Pope et al., 2015; Quaas et al., 2015). Thus, we
maintain that long-term exposure to hormonal treatment is likely to
contribute to what may be termed the endometriosis brain. However,
given that the treatment reduces the pain, it is associated with more
positive than negative effects. Thus, because hormone therapy alleviates
pain, it can be seen as a factor that helps reduce the load of psychiatric
comorbidities. Only four out of the nine studies analyzed in the present
review reported on hormone therapy of the participants (see Table 2),
with no association being detected between the treatment and the
development of a bipolar disorder (Chen et al., 2020; Kumar et al.,
2011). Additionally, no influence of the duration of hormonal treatment
on the incidence of depressive disorders was observed (Warzecha et al.,
2020).
One intriguing observation is that the prevalence of bipolar disorder
in women with endometriosis is much higher than in the general pop­
ulation. However, the data in this regard are quite wide-ranging,
reaching more than 40% in the study by Kumar et al. (2011), whereas
only 0.55% of the unselected female world population is affected by the
illness (The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2019, Fig. 4).
Despite being repeatedly indicated by different studies (Chen et al.,
2020; Dinsdale & Crespi, 2017; Kumar et al., 2011; Pope et al., 2015),
the connection between bipolar disorder and endometriosis remains
unclear. Unlike depression or anxiety, pain seems not to play a leading
role in bipolar disorder, the condition not being found to be more
prevalent in patients with other chronic pain conditions (Kumar et al.,
2011). However, the hormonal effects (e.g. fluctuation of circulating sex
hormones in women, especially in relation to the menstrual cycle) seem
to play a role. Generally, surgical menopause (e.g. after bilateral oo­
phorectomy) has a negative impact on future psychosexual as well as
cognitive and mental health (Hickey et al., 2010). Women with hys­
terectomy seem to have an increased risk of bipolar disorder, especially
if oophorectomy is simultaneously performed or endometriosis is pre­
sent (Shen et al., 2019). According to some reports, women with bipolar
disorder have high rates of premenstrual worsening of mood (Blehar
et al., 1998), which has also been observed in women suffering from
endometriosis (e.g. Tanaka et al., 2016). Also, in some cases (due to
extreme mood swings), endometriosis with severe menstrual symptoms
can mimic the symptoms of bipolar disorder, particularly the so-called
rapid cycling bipolar disorder. The premenstrual symptoms, observed
in patients with both endometriosis and bipolar disorder, may indicate
common pathogenetic mechanisms like altered susceptibility to men­
strual cycle-dependent hormonal fluctuation, resulting in menstrual
distress. However, this issue is yet to be thoroughly investigated. Dys­
regulations within the female oxytocin system, which are observed in

women with endometriosis, may mirror potential malfunction of the
hypothalamic-pituitary–gonadal axis, increasing the risk of bipolar dis­
order (Dinsdale & Crespi, 2017). This assumption, however, remains
controversial and requires further investigation (Rutigliano et al., 2016).
Other factors that appear to play an important role in the development
of psychiatric comorbidities in patients with endometriosis are inflam­
mation and genetic predisposition. Several meta-analyses have shown
increased levels of inflammatory markers in patients with bipolar dis­
order, including soluble interleukin (IL)-2 receptor (sIL-2R), sIL-6R,
TNF-alpha, soluble TNF receptor-1, and IL-4 (Modabbernia et al.,
2013; Rowland et al., 2018). Based on that, it has been suggested that
inflammation and oxidative stress are connected in complex ways to
impaired neuroplasticity and, thus, to the development of bipolar dis­
order (Wollenhaupt-Aguiar et al., 2021) and a number of psychiatric
disorders including depression (Beurel et al., 2013) and psychosis
(Müller et al., 2015). At least some of these proinflammatory changes
have also been observed in patients with endometriosis (Zondervan
et al., 2020). In addition, various genetic confounders may account for
the frequent comorbidity between mental disorders and endometriosis.
Gao et al. (2020), for instance, have found female siblings of patients
with endometriosis to be at an increased risk of developing mental
disorders, even if they themselves do not suffer from endometriosis. In
line with that, a recent study has suggested a common genetic etiology
linked to gastric mucosa abnormalities in patients with endometriosis
and depression (Adewuyi et al., 2021). According to this study (and
contrary to previous reports), a somewhat similar genetic etiology, but
not pain (or chronic pain), is likely to be the key determinant of the
association between endometriosis and depression (Adewuyi et al.,
2021). Similar analyses with respect to genetic factors influencing the
prevalence of bipolar depression or other psychiatric conditions in
women with endometriosis would be useful.
4.2. Complex reciprocal relationship between mental problems and
endometriosis
Collectively, the studies analyzed here highlight a complex and
sometimes reciprocal relationship between endometriosis and mental
health. Comorbid mental disorders in patients with endometriosis are
usually prognostically unfavorable as they may aggravate symptoms of
the disease, affect quality of life and increase the therapy costs (Mirkin
et al., 2007; Valderas et al., 2009). In women with endometriosis, pain is
thought to play a crucial role in the development of mental problems
like depression or anxiety. On the other hand, psychiatric history also
seems to be a risk factor for the development of endometriosis. For
instance, women with a history of mental disorder (e.g. psychosis,
depressive disorder, anxiety, eating or personality disorder, or attentiondeficit hyperactivity disorder) are more likely to be diagnosed with
endometriosis (Gao et al., 2020). Altered pain perception, which is
frequently observed in psychiatric disorders (in particular, in anxiety
disorder or depression) (Gorczyca et al., 2013; Thompson et al., 2016),
likely contributes to earlier manifestation and diagnosis of endometri­
osis via symptoms of pain. Also, genetically-determined hormonal
imbalance, central sensitization due to inflammation or early life stress,
changes in various biological pathways and neurotransmitters or
oxytocin levels may increase the susceptibility not only to endometri­
osis, but also to mental disorders (Dinsdale & Crespi, 2017; Gambassi,
2009). In addition, in women with affective disorder, changes in the
affective state can be provoked by hormonal fluctuations during the
menstrual cycle (Albert & Newhouse, 2019), indicating an elevated
susceptibility to menstrual cycle-dependent hormonal fluctuations. To
what degree it may be the case in patients with endometriosis, remains
to be determined.
All in all, pain, infertility, the presence of somatic comorbidities,
shared genetic vulnerability or altered immunological response as well
as commonly prescribed hormonal therapies can contribute to the
development of psychiatric disorders in women with endometriosis.

While it is unclear whether psychiatric disorders represent the causes or
the consequences of endometriosis, it is highly likely that they can be
both causes and consequences depending on individual circumstances.

inside the body (interoceptive awareness) in the context of emotional
processing (Khalsa et al., 2009). The mPFC, on the other hand, receives
ascending, nociceptive and interoceptive inputs and also exerts impor­
tant top-down control of pain sensation, evaluation and categorization
of interoceptive stimuli (Kummer et al., 2020). Thus, a disturbance in
the regulatory function of the PFC with respect to the amygdala or the
ACC can contribute to central sensitization and, consequently, to the
development of inflammatory or neuropathic pain (Kummer et al.,
2020).
In symptomatic endometriosis patients (compared to their agematched, pain-free counterparts), an enhanced connectivity has been
observed between the anterior insula and the mPFC, the connectivity
strength correlating with the severity of pain, anxiety and depression
(As-Sanie et al., 2016), underscoring, once again, the role of negative
emotions in the development of chronic pain. Other neuroimaging
studies in humans have demonstrated how the anterior insula and the
mPFC can be linked to the subjective perception of pain and its modu­
lation based on the context of pain experience. Moreover, even in
healthy controls, the anterior insula-mPFC connectivity has been found
to be enhanced during the experience of uncontrollable pain (Bräscher
et al., 2016). As patients suffering from endometriosis often report
feeling a loss of control, perceiving the pain as unpredictable (Rush &
Misajon, 2018), the alteration in their anterior insula-mPFC connectivity
may no longer be only context-dependent but also permanently altered.
In patients with endometriosis, Beissner et al. (2018) have shown the
role of the connectivity between the anterior hippocampus (the region
involved in the processing of anxiety, stress regulation and affective
(autobiographic) memory (LaBar & Cabeza, 2006; Zeidman & Maguire,
2016) and the regions forming the viscerosensory pathways. Following
psychotherapy and acupuncture and the consequent reduction in pain, a
reduced connectivity has been seen between the anterior hippocampus
and the somatosensory cortex, the anterior insula/temporal pole and the
mPFC (Beissner et al., 2018). In addition, a reduced resting-state con­
nectivity between this network and the right anterolateral hippocampus
has been found to be predicted by therapy-induced reductions in trait
anxiety (Beissner et al., 2018) and not by pain scores. Collectively, these
neuroimaging studies underscore the role of the mPFC, the anterior
insula, the somatosensory cortex and the anterior hippocampus/amyg­
dala/temporal pole in the perception and regulation of pain in patients
suffering from endometriosis. Highlighting the role of negative emo­
tions, such as depression or anxiety, in the pain experience of these
patients, the results show why pain management alone is often not
sufficient to mitigate the experience of pain in endometriosis.

4.3. Limitations of the analyzed studies on endometriosis and
comorbidities
Our systematic review of the literature helped to identify several
limitations in the studies involving the comorbidity between mental
disorders and endometriosis. All the analyzed studies suffer from, among
other things, a lack of effective operationalization, including the dif­
ferentiation between symptomatic or asymptomatic endometriosis and
the stage of the disease. None of the studies involved a systematic
investigation of asymptomatic endometriosis in contrast to the symp­
tomatic disease course. Since the majority of the studies were retro­
spective cohort trials, based on medical databases, the diagnostic
approaches to endometriosis showed a considerable variation. Despite
laparoscopy with the histological confirmation of endometriosis being
the diagnostic gold standard, some studies also included patients who
had been diagnosed by other methods, e.g. ultrasound (e.g. Warzecha
et al., 2020). Furthermore, no detailed information was made available
with respect to the mental disorders investigated in combination with
the related symptoms. For instance, anxiety disorders, which comprise a
variety of symptoms according to ICD (World Health Organization,
2020), were often not differentiated (e.g. Gao et al., 2020). Also, the
control groups used as a reference for comparison with endometriosis
patients varied from healthy controls to patients with chronic pain of
other origin or uterus fibroids (e.g. Cavaggioni et al., 2014; Gao et al.,
2020; Kumar et al., 2011; Taran et al., 2010). Additionally, there was
often no information about the onset of mental disorders and endome­
triosis, with only Gao et al. (2020) including data on a months-long lag
between the diagnoses of endometriosis and mental disorders. This
heterogeneity likely influenced the results, restricting the establishment
of a causal relationship between endometriosis and comorbid mental
disorders.
4.4. Pain processing networks and endometriosis
Given the role of central sensitization in the development of chronic
pain, it is surprising that, to date, only three studies have (indirectly)
addressed this issue using brain neuroimaging techniques in patients
with endometriosis. Chronic pain is known to be associated with alter­
ations in brain structure and connectivity (Alshelh et al., 2018; Tatu
et al., 2018). In women with symptomatic endometriosis (compared to
healthy controls), As-sanie et al. (2012) have observed gray matter
volume reduction in the thalamus, the cingulate, the insula, the puta­
men, the mPFC, the hippocampus and the somatosensory cortices, re­
gions that are involved both in the affective and sensory aspects of pain
processing (Apkarian et al., 2009; Gambassi, 2009). The lateral thal­
amus and the primary and secondary somatosensory cortices in partic­
ular are responsible for the sensory aspects of pain (constituting the socalled primary sensory pathway), processing acute pain stimuli like
duration, intensity and pain localization. On the other hand, the medial
thalamus and the mPFC (along with the amygdala, the PAG and the
hypothalamus) are thought to be key brain areas comprising the affec­
tive pathway, which likely modulates the nociceptive processing of pain
(Apkarian et al., 2009). The insular cortices seem to be involved in both
(the affective and the sensory) pathways (Apkarian et al., 2009; Gam­
bassi, 2009). In this regard, the increased amygdala volume in symp­
tomatic endometriosis patients is noteworthy (As-sanie et al., 2012;
Fig. 6) given that, as one of the central structures of the affective pain
processing pathway, the amygdala modulates the emotional aspects of
pain perception, emotional learning and memory (Davis & Whalen,
2001; Quirk & Beer, 2006) as well as fear and anxiety (Davis, 1992).
Similarly, the anterior insula and the anterior cingulate and somato­
sensory cortices are thought to mediate perception of sensations from

4.5. Not only pain but also emotion, cognition, self-regulation and reward
The regions associated with endometriosis play a role not only in
pain processing but also in a large number of disparate processes
including the regulation of emotions (e.g. insula, mPFC/ACC, hippo­
campus, amygdala), cognition (e.g. mPFC, hippocampus, insula), moti­
vation (e.g. mPFC), social reward system (e.g. basal ganglia,
hippocampus, thalamus, amygdala), self-regulation and social norma­
tive behavior (e.g. anterior insula, mPFC) (Bellucci et al., 2018; Etkin
et al., 2011; Felix-Ortiz et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2019; LaBar & Cabeza,
2006; Sesack & Grace, 2010; Stein, 2015; Van Overwalle, 2009; Zeid­
man & Maguire, 2016). They have also been found to be linked to a
number of psychiatric conditions. Studies in MDD have identified
functional as well as structural abnormalities in the mPFC (particularly
in the subgenual cingulate cortex), the hippocampus and the amygdala
(Gray et al., 2020). The amygdala and the mPFC play a crucial role in the
regulation of fear and anxiety (Davis, 1992), and both regions have been
shown to be altered in anxiety disorders (Etkin et al., 2009; Stein, 2015).
Alterations in the gray matter volume of the amygdala, the insula and
the mPFC/cingulate cortex have been demonstrated in patients with
depression and bipolar disorders (Gray et al., 2020; Usher et al., 2010;
Wise et al., 2017). Given the substantial overlap between brain regions
11

Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology 65 (2022) 100988

involved in a number of psychiatric conditions (e.g. depression, anxiety
and bipolar disorders) and chronic pain, it is hardly surprising that both
psychiatric and chronic neuropathic pain conditions are frequently
linked to anxiety, depressive symptoms and reduced sociability (Kum­
mer et al., 2020). As the mPFC is involved in aversive learning, memory
as well as top-down control of pain sensation, the region is thought to
serve as a hub for the development of chronic pain-related mental
comorbidities such as depression and anxiety (Kummer et al., 2020). It is
conceivable, therefore, that the clinical manifestation of depression or
anxiety disorder or any other psychiatric condition can potentially affect
the treatment of endometriosis (e.g. intercourse with pain relief and
improvement of quality of life). All of this underscores the role of
emotions (e.g. anxiety or sadness) in the development of endometriosisspecific symptoms in patients, explaining why endometriosis is so
frequently associated with psychiatric comorbidities, and how negative
emotions, perception of pain or psychiatric comorbidity may contribute
to central sensitization.

therapy is one of the most daunting challenges associated with the
treatment of endometriosis. Alongside adjuvant hormone treatment
aimed at the prevention of disease recurrence and pharmaceutical
analgesia, additional therapy options need to be considered to achieve
an optimal symptom control in patients with endometriosis(Horne et al.,
2017). In this context, finding ways to prevent or contend with the
development of central sensitization, and as a result chronic pain, may be
a key step toward addressing the issue. The enhanced sensitivity to pain
(e.g. toward thermal pain or application of pressure or electrical energy)
in women with CPP both with and without endometriosis (Bajaj et al.,
2003; Brawn et al., 2014; Laursen et al., 2005) shows that, in both
conditions, the experience of pain is deeply altered. Therefore, besides
the morphometric and connectivity evaluation based on neuroimaging
techniques, stimulation of pain receptors in the peripheral tissues
through mechanical (pressure, pinch) pain perception tasks, and pain
modulation with emotional stimuli, may afford more insight into the
perception of pain in patients with CPP in general and with endome­
triosis in particular. Although the thermal, pressure or chemical stimuli
of pain perception tasks are not directly related to the perception of
visceral internal pain, they can point to the dysregulation between the
mPFC and the networks involved in different levels of pain processing,
possibly revealing the differences between brain alterations related to
endometriosis or CPP. A neuroimaging assessment of mPFC activity
based on nociceptive stimulation can shed light on how pain informa­
tion (pain stimuli or nociceptive stimuli) is integrated with memory,
mood or spatial awareness (Ong et al., 2019). The development of tasks
that can help assess visceral pain sensation more directly ought to be
another important goal.
As pain includes a component of unpleasantness, triggering the
aversive drive to eliminate the cause, it is often described by adjectives
(e.g. nagging, uncomfortable, excruciating) that do not accurately
reflect the sensory experience. Changes in mood also influence the af­
fective aspects of pain perception (Institute of Medicine, 1987). There­
fore, exploring the interconnection between pain and mental health
conditions through multimodal means, including neuroimaging, may
help pave the way for effective, individualized treatment of endome­
triosis. Factors such as distraction, positive mood, and anticipation of
(placebo-induced) pain relief have been found to mitigate pain by
exerting influence on the mPFC, making it a promising target region for
pain therapy (Kummer et al., 2020). Additionally, novel therapies tar­
geting the activity of nerves both in the endometriosis lesions and the
nervous system through inhibition of nociceptive ion channels or neu­
ropeptides involved in generating hyperalgesic reactions (e.g. calcitonin
gene-related peptide) may add to the multimodal therapy concepts
(Saunders & Horne, 2021).
Although the link between mental disorders, pain and endometriosis
appears to be robust, it is difficult to determine if endometriosis per se is
associated with alterations in brain structure, function or connectivity.
The observed alterations in brain structure or resting-state connectivity
may be due only to comorbid mood disorders and chronic pain. It is
unknown if women with endometriosis have structural and
connectivity-related brain alterations that are specific to endometriosis.
And if the endometriosis brain does exist, we hypothesize that women
with endometriosis may demonstrate alterations in the brain regions
associated with different levels of pain experience, e.g. the sensory and
emotional aspects. In particular, the regions that are known to play a
role in central sensitization, like the brain stem, the thalamus and the
cerebral cortex, are also likely to be altered by endometriosis. In addi­
tion to pain processing, cognitive, emotional or reward resources and
functions, overlapping with changes observed in patients with other
chronic pain conditions or mental disorders (particularly depressive or
anxiety disorders) (Apkarian et al., 2009; Gray et al., 2020; Kaiser et al.,
2015; Tatu et al., 2018), are likely to contribute to the formation of the
endometriosis brain. Thus, alterations in gray matter volume and restingstate connectivity are likely in the regions (such as the amygdala, the
mPFC and the anterior cingulate cortex and possibly also the

4.6. Limitations of the analyzed neuroimaging studies on endometriosis
The neuroimaging studies on endometriosis that have been analyzed
here suffer from several noteworthy drawbacks. Only two small studies
compare brain morphology and resting-state connectivity between
women with endometriosis and healthy controls. Additionally, they
include the same cohort of only 17 patients with symptomatic endo­
metriosis and a comparable number of asymptomatic patients (As-sanie
et al., 2012; As-Sanie et al., 2016). No comparison with healthy controls
is included in the study by Beissner et al. (2018). Thus, of the three
neuroimaging studies involving patients with endometriosis, two are
published by one research group, that of As-sanie et al. (2012; 2016).
Given the limited sample sizes, the observed changes in brain structure
and connectivity may have been influenced by individual characteristics
of the study participants and, therefore, may not be generalizable to the
population of women with endometriosis as a whole. For instance, the
hormone therapy, which was used by half of the participants with
symptomatic endometriosis in the studies by As-Sanie et al. (As-sanie
et al., 2012; As-Sanie et al., 2016), may also have influenced the brain
morphometry and function. However, it is unlikely that the described
changes (As-sanie et al., 2012; As-Sanie et al., 2016) can be explained
solely in terms of the influence of hormones, since the proportion of
women receiving hormone therapy was similar between the control
group and patients with symptomatic endometriosis (As-sanie et al.,
2012; As-Sanie et al., 2016). Moreover, the alterations observed in these
studies do not completely overlap with brain changes associated with
hormone therapies (Toffoletto et al., 2014). Besides, Beissner et al.
(2018), who demonstrate connectivity alterations during psychothera­
peutic intervention with somatosensory stimulation in endometriosis
patients, included only women without hormone therapy. While they
afford important insight, the results of these three studies need to be
treated with caution until they are replicated in larger patient collec­
tives. To control for the disorder’s heterogeneity, the neuroimaging data
need to be correlated with the clinical data and the objectively assessed
psychopathological comorbidities in larger patient groups. Finally, as
most neuroimaging studies on chronic pain and mental disorders do not
control for possible gender/sex effects (Gray et al., 2020; Kaiser et al.,
2015), any indirect comparison of structural and connectivity alter­
ations between women with endometriosis and patients with chronic
pain or mood disorders is likely to be biased. Therefore, it is difficult to
conclude if brain changes in patients with depression and chronic pain
are gender-specific. Several meta-analyses on this issue show contra­
dictory results (Iwabuchi et al., 2015; Kambeitz et al., 2017; Wise et al.,
2017).

The frequent recurrence of symptoms following (repeated) surgical

hippocampus) potentiated by (chronic) pain signals, with the regions, in
turn, modulating the signals’ salience leading to pain-related memories
and behavioral changes. The severity of perceived pain is also likely to
correlate with changes in GMV and resting-state connectivity as seen in
other patients with chronic pain (Barroso et al., 2021; Napadow et al.
2010; Wood, 2010). However, it is possible that factors other than pain
or mental disorders may also induce brain changes in patients with
endometriosis. Because hormone therapy is routinely prescribed to pa­
tients with endometriosis (Brown et al., 2018), it may be considered as a
potential contributing factor to the endometriosis brain, and, given its
effectiveness with respect to pain relief, the treatment can have a pro­
tective effect in some cases, lowering the number of psychiatric
comorbidities. Therefore, studies involving patients with asymptomatic
endometriosis as well as those aiming to investigate the influence of
hormone therapies on brain and mood changes can shed more light on
possible pain-independent brain and mood alterations. Altogether, more
research is required before any definitive conclusion can be drawn
regarding the endometriosis brain.
For effective preventive measures and individualized therapeutic
approaches toward maximizing treatment success, clinically informative
endometriosis subphenotypes need to be accurately categorized by
means of multimodal imaging, socio-economic characteristics, clinicalanamnestic data, confirmed diagnosis of comorbidities (e.g. mental
disorders), inflammatory status, immunohistochemical analysis of the
tissue, genetic analysis and personality and temperament traits. Multi­
modal neuroimaging approaches combined with reliable diagnostics of
comorbid mental disorders will afford a better understanding of the
disease, thereby contributing to the development of optimal therapeutic
concepts for different subgroups of patients with endometriosis. Finally,
the available therapeutic options seem to allow successful treatment of
only a part of the patient population with endometriosis. To improve
clinical practice, it will be necessary to determine the factors, such as,
possibly, comorbid mental disorders and pain as a psychological
symptom, that are negatively associated with therapy response
following surgery. The identification (prediction) and characterization
of patients who experience no (or only marginal) symptom relief
following surgical therapy will help lower the rate of unnecessary (re­
petitive) surgeries and the associated perioperative morbidity. There­
fore, larger longitudinal studies are needed to define and validate
optimal therapy concepts for different subgroups of patients with
endometriosis with respect to the identified psychiatric comorbidities,
anamnestic characteristics, and neuroimaging and biological markers
predicting therapy response.

multimodal research (including neuroimaging) and longitudinal followup in this area is striking. Generally, functional brain imaging studies
addressing reproductive cycle-related mood disorders (“women-specific
conditions” such as depression during female puberty, premenstrual
dysphoric disorder, postpartum depression disorder) are quite scarce
(Stickel et al., 2019), which is a clear indication of a gender-bias in
research against the female population. There is an urgent need to
improve awareness and education and adopt effective measures given
the high prevalence of endometriosis and its cumulative effect on
women’s health and well-being across the lifespan. Biomarkers (e.g.
neuroimaging, genetic, inflammatory or immunohistochemical bio­
markers) and new therapeutics are needed to target the physiological
pathways linked to the development, progression and symptom persis­
tence of the disease. It is only through sufficiently powered, collabora­
tive, multidisciplinary research, enabled by funding bodies through
prioritization of endometriosis as a critical public health issue, that real
progress can be achieved.

5. Conclusion
Based on these studies’ objective assessment of psychopathological
comorbidities, using clinical diagnostic criteria, we can safely conclude
that there is a high prevalence of mental disorders in patients with
endometriosis. We postulate that almost one-third of patients need
professional psychiatric or psychotherapeutic help for one or several
psychiatric conditions.
At the same time, it is clear that very little is known about the
structural and functional brain alterations in patients suffering from
endometriosis in terms of chronic pain or mental comorbidities and also
in relation to the so-called endometriosis brain. A total of only about 30
patients with endometriosis were investigated in these studies by neu­
roimaging, which is a very small number given the heterogeneity of the
condition. This becomes particularly clear in comparison to the neuro­
imaging studies related to other conditions. For instance, a recent metaanalysis on depression has identified as many as 92 studies on brain
morphology with 3,000 MDD patients (Gray et al., 2020; Wise et al.,
2017) and up to 25 studies on functional connectivity including 560
MDD patients (Iwabuchi et al., 2015; Kaiser et al., 2015). In view of the
high prevalence of endometriosis and its profound long-term impact on
the life quality of affected women, the paucity of high-quality
