ABSTRACT

Sixty women with a diagnosis of endometriosis (30 with low
pain severity - LP; 30 with high pain severity - HP) were evaluated at study entry (T0) and after three months (T1). At T0
they were compared for different psychological dimensions to
sixty-two age-paired healthy women (CG). HP group had significantly higher scores on depressive symptomatology, sexual
distress, and catastrophizing than CG, and higher scores on
worry traits than LP. Metacognitive beliefs predicted sexual
distress at T1, over and above pain severity. Pain affects different domains of mental health in this population. Coping
strategies, metacognitive beliefs, and worry traits may modulate
pain experience and psychological distress.

Pain severely impacts quality of life and mental health of women with
endometriosis. However, few is still known about relationships between
pain severity and quality of life, mental health, and beliefs. Furthermore,
few studies have investigated the predictive value of metacognitive beliefs
to subsequent quality of life and mental health among this population. In
this manuscript, we discussed main outcomes of a prospective case-control
study on women with a diagnosis of endometriosis. Women with endometriosis were assessed two times (T0 and T1, three months follow-up)
and compared to a control group (CG). Quality of life, worry trait, depression, sexual distress, pain, coping strategies and metacognitive beliefs were
assessed by means of validated questionnaires.
Background

Worldwide, 150 million women suffer from endometriosis. Endometriosis
is a gynecological chronic condition, defined as the presence of

endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, which induces a chronic and
inflammatory reaction (Dunselman et al., 2014; Kennedy et al., 2005). The
disorder is known to lead to painful symptomatology (i.e. chronic pelvic
pain, dyspareunia, dyschesia, low back pain, and dysmenorrhea; Vigano
et al., 2004), low quality of life and severe psychological disturbances
(Culley et al., 2013; Pope et al., 2015). According to a range of studies,
women with endometriosis show significantly higher levels of depression,
somatization, sensitivity, and anxiety when compared to controls (
Gambadauro et al., 2019; Laganà et al., 2015; Vitale, La Rosa, Rapisarda,
& Lagana et al., 2017 ). The impact of pain is so noticeable that several
authors have suggested that the pain severity is the major responsible of
the psychological distress on this population (Cavaggioni et al., 2014;
Culley et al., 2013; De Graaff et al., 2013; Dunselman et al., 2014; Facchin
et al., 2015; Gambadauro et al., 2019; Lagana et al., 2015; 2017; Lorencatto
et al., 2006; Moradi et al., 2014; Pope et al., 2015; Sepulcri & Do Amaral,
2009; Souza et al., 2011). Recent literature evidenced that psychological
and cognitive factors may influence pain experience of women with endometriosis (Zarbo et al., 2018), highlighting that women with chronic pelvic
pain related-endometriosis are more likely to repress emotions that the
control group (i.e. healthy women). In addition, some coping strategies
(i.e. suppression of emotions, pain catastrophizing and passive coping style)
are related to higher self-reported pain. Furthermore, some coping strategies (i.e. focused on emotions, detached and rational) seem to be related
to better mental health, while other (i.e. emotional and avoidance coping
styles) to poorer mental status (Donatti et al., 2017; Zarbo et al., 2018).
In addition, the recent mixed-method study of Zarbo et al. (2019)
delineated a model of onset and maintenance of acute pain experience in
women with endometriosis in which personality traits and coping strategies
play a key role. According to the model, psychological distress may be
both cause (possibly due to neurophysiological or attentional mechanisms)
and consequence of acute pain in this population. The onset of acute pain
is related to automatic ruminative, self-blaming and catastrophizing
thoughts and to the need to control it which, in turn, bring the woman
to engage in a range of unsuccessful coping strategies, leading to the onset
of a vicious circle characterized by negative feelings and emotions (i.e.
powerlessness), attempt to control the thoughts (i.e. trying suppressing
them) and psychological distress (Zarbo et al., 2019).
In this context, the metacognitive model of Wells and Simons (2009)
could provide an efficient framework for improving the knowledge of the
effects of pain on women’s lives and mental disturbances in this population. Indeed, cognitions and beliefs about worries about pain (i.e. metacognitive beliefs) could impact the way the woman copes with the stressor

144

(i.e. the pain) and affect, indirectly, quality of life and mental health.
Metacognitive beliefs are defined as “stable knowledge or beliefs about
one’s cognitive system, and knowledge about factors that affect the functioning of the system” (Wells, 1995). To the best of our knowledge, to
date, only one (cross-sectional) study focused on metacognitive beliefs in
this population. The study found that negative beliefs about worries affect
sexual distress over and above dyspareunia and chronic pain (Zarbo et
al., 2018).
Concluding, in order to overcome existing limitations of literature, the
main aims of this research study were: a) to assess differences in quality
of life, mental health (i.e. trait worry, depressive symptomatology, sexual
distress), coping strategies and metacognitive beliefs between women with
low-pain endometriosis, women with high-pain endometriosis, and healthy
women; b) to assess the predictive role of metacognitive beliefs on mental
quality of life, depression and sexual distress outcomes after 3 months.
Material and methods
Participants and procedure

From December 2016 to April 2018, women with a diagnosis of endometriosis were recruited from a hospital in North Italy to take part to this
prospective case-control study. We included women with a diagnosis of
endometriosis, without past or concurrent neurological and psychiatric
disorders or severe medical conditions, and able to write and read in
Italian language. A total of sixty-eight women that met inclusion criteria
were approached to take part to the study in the department of obstetrics
and gynecology or outpatient clinics in an Hospital in North Italy. Eight
of them refused (12%), while sixty (88%) were enrolled in the study.
During the enrollment phase (T0), participants completed a range of
self-report questionnaires, and had a clinical interview with a trained
psychologist and a gynecologist. Psychologist did a structural interview to
collect sociodemographic information and data related to current and past
psychiatric or neurological disorders, as well as assisted participants during
the compilation of questionnaires. Gynecologist was responsible for the
gynaecological examination and for collecting information about the disorder (i.e. symptomatology, previous treatments, localization, etc.).
After three months (T1), women with endometriosis were contacted to
complete a part of questionnaires. Twenty-five women accepted to participate to the second evaluation. Basing on their clinical history and gynecological examinations, from T0 to T1, women with endometriosis received
specific treatments. In particular, 10 (40%) of them received only hormonal
treatment, 3 (12%) of them did only surgical treatment, 10 (40%) of them

Health Care for Women International

145

received both hormonal and surgical treatments, and 2 (8%) of them
received no treatment.
At T0, the group of women with endometriosis was compared to a
control group of sixty-two healthy women recruited from general population (e.g. non-medical staff of the hospital, friends or relatives) by email
or direct approach. We enrolled women that met the following inclusion
criteria: having not a chronic gynaecological disorder, not reporting past
or concurrent neurological and psychiatric disorders or severe medical
conditions, and being able to write and read in Italian language. Inclusion
criteria were listed in informed consent and eligibility of participants was
assessed by self-reported answers to a questionnaire developed ad hoc.
Control group was matched for age with the group of women with
endometriosis.
A priori power analysis has been calculated to determine an adequate
sample size for the study. The study was conducted in accordance with
American Psychological Association (1992) ethical standards for the treatment of human experimental volunteers; each participant provided consent
in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association,
2013). Informed consent was read and signed by all participants. The
study was accepted by the Ethical Committee of Papa Giovanni XXIII
Hospital in Bergamo (Italy).
Instruments

Sociodemographic and clinical information (about endometriosis or other
medical conditions) were collected by means of a structured interview by
a gynecologist and a psychologist. Quality of life, mental health, coping
strategies, metacognitive beliefs, and pain symptomatology were collected
by means of the following validated self-report questionnaires.
SF-12 health survey

(Gandek et al., 1998; Kodraliu et al., 2001) is a 12 item self-report questionnaire that allows the evaluation of the quality of life in several domains.
Physical Component Scale (PCS) and Mental Component Scale (MCS) are
the two main scales that assess, respectively, the physical and mental
domain of quality of life. Both original and Italian versions of the scale
showed good validity. In this study, it was administered to endometriosis
group and control group at T0, and to endometriosis group at T1.
Short-Form McGill pain questionnaire

(SF-MPQ; Melzack, 2010) is a self-report scale for the evaluation of pain
severity that includes 15 items and two subscales: Affective subscale and

146

C. ZARBO ET AL.

Somatic subscale. Moreover, a total score can be obtained summing all
items. Pain intensity for each adjective related to pain experience is assessed
in a scale from 0 (none) to 3 (severe). The scale, in this study, was completed by women with endometriosis at both T0 and T1.
Patient health questionnaire 9 items

(PHQ9; Mazzotti et al., 2003; Spitzer et al., 1999) is a brief self-report
questionnaire for the evaluation of major depressive symptoms basing on
DSM-IV criteria. Cutoff points allow discriminating stage of depressive
symptomatology (i.e. minimal, minor, moderately severe, and severe depression). High sensitivity and specificity (88%) for major depression has been
found in the original version of the scale. In this study, women with
endometriosis completed PHQ9 at both T0 and T1, while the control
group completed it only at T0.
Penn state worry questionnaire

(PSWQ; Meyer et al., 1990; Morani et al., 1999) is a self-report questionnaire including 16 items that allows the assessment of worry traits.
The PSWQ is a trait measure that concerns the habit of worrying in
general regardless of moments in time and of the circumstances. Both
the original version and the Italian validation showed good internal
consistency (Meyer et al., 1990; Morani et al., 1999). In this study,
both women with endometriosis and healthy ones completed
PSWQ at T0.
Female sexual distress Scale-R

(FSDS-r; Derogatis et al., 2008) is a 13-item self-report questionnaire that
assesses distress related to sexuality over the previous 7 days. Sexual distress
can be diagnosed when the FSDS-R total score is higher than 11. The
scale demonstrated a high degree of internal consistency, as well as good
discriminant validity and test-retest reliability (Derogatis et al., 2008). In
this study, women with endometriosis completed FSDS-r at both T0 and
T1, while the control group completed it only at T0.
Cognitive emotion regulation questionnaire – short version

(CERQ-short; Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006) is a self-report multidimensional
scale that includes 18 items that assesses coping strategies in term of
individuals’ thoughts after having experienced a negative event. Cognitive
coping strategies refer to rather stable styles of dealing with negative life
events. The scale includes nine subscales, which are self-blame, acceptance,
rumination, positive refocusing, refocus on planning, positive reappraisal,

Health Care for Women International

147

putting into perspective, catastrophizing, and other-blame. The scale has
demonstrated good reliability and validity (Garnefski & Kraaij, 2006). In
this study, both women with endometriosis and healthy ones completed
the scale at T0.
Meta-Cognitions questionnaire

(MCQ-30; Cartwright-Hatton & Wells, 2009; Quattropani et al., 2014) is
a 30-item self-report scale for the assessment of metacognitive beliefs. The
scale is divided into five subscales, which are the “positive beliefs” about
worry (POS), “negative beliefs” about the uncontrollability of thoughts and
corresponding danger (NEG), the “cognitive confidence” (CC), the “Need
to control thoughts” (NC), and the “cognitive self-consciousness” (CSC).
The Italian version of the MCQ-30 (Quattropani et al., 2014) demonstrated
good psychometric properties, satisfactory internal consistency, and convergent validity, as well as a good test-retest reliability. In this study, both
women with endometriosis and healthy women completed MCQ-30at T0.
Statistical analyses

Preliminary analyses were performed to ensure no violation of the assumption of normality. In order to reach our first aim (i.e. assessing differences
in quality of life, mental health, coping strategies and metacognitive beliefs
between women with low-pain endometriosis, women with high-pain
endometriosis, and healthy women) we performed one-way between-groups
multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs). Low and high pain groups
were shaped based on the median score on MPQ-SF total score. The
dependent variable was the group: women with low pain endometriosis
(LP), women with high pain endometriosis (HP), control group (CG).
Independent variables were psychological and cognitive scores. Effect sizes
were evaluated using Partial η2 and interpreted according to the guidelines
(small > 0.01; medium > 0.06; large > 0.14; Leech et al., 2005). Tukey
HSD was applied for post-hoc group comparisons.
In addition, in order to assess our second aim regarding the predictive
role of MCQ-30at T0 to subsequent (after three months) mental quality
of life, depressive symptomatology and sexual distress in women with
endometriosis, we performed hierarchical multiple regressions. Therefore,
we inserted – respectively- T1_MCS, T1_PHQ9, T1_FSDS as dependent
variables. T0_MPQ and - respectively - T0_MCS, T0_PHQ9, T0_FSDS
were inserted in Block 1 to be controlled. T0_MCQ-30 was inserted at
block 2 as predictor.
Confounding variables were identified basing on previous literature,
conceptual framework and knowledge on the topic. Preliminary regression

148

C. ZARBO ET AL.

models were performed in order to investigate the separate and joint
effects of variables. R-squared, Adjusted R-squared and F-test were used
for assessing fit of multivariable models.
All statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 23.0 and STATISTICA. All statistical
tests were two-sided; a p-value ≤.05 was considered significant.

Results

Standardized scores and box plots were used to identify univariate outliers.
Variables with values +/- 3.29 SD from the mean were considered outliers.
Outlier values were brought into range according to Tabachnick and Fidell
(2007). Normality of each group was assessed for each variable by examining box-plots, stem and leaf plots, histograms, and skewness and kurtosis
values. Results revealed no issues with normality. Missing data were not
imputed and were treated as missing. Sociodemographic and clinical information of women with endometriosis (N = 60) and control group (N = 62)
at T0 are shown in Table 1.
One-way between-groups multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs)
were performed to investigate differences in quality of life, mental health,
coping strategies and metacognitive beliefs in three groups (i.e. LP; HP;
CG). Analyses revealed significant effect of group for PCS, PHQ9, PSWQ,
FSDS-r, Refocus planning, Positive reappraisal, and Catastrophizing. Tukey
HSD post-hoc comparisons evidenced that HP group had significantly: a)
lower scores on PCS than both LP group and CG; b) higher scores on
PHQ9, FSDS-r, and Catastrophizing than CG. LP group had significantly:
a) lower scores on PCS, PSWQ, Positive reappraisal, and Refocus planning
than CG; b) lower scores on PSWQ than HP group. No significant differences among groups were found for MCS, Self-blame, Acceptance,
Rumination, Positive Refocusing, Putting Perspective, Other blame,
MCQ30_POS, MCQ-30_NEG, MCQ30_CC, MCQ-30_CSC, and MCQ30
total score. All means, standard errors, F values, Partial η2, and significance
levels are reported in Table 2.
Then, Hierarchical multiple regressions were used to assess the ability
of MCQ-30 at T0 to predict levels of subsequent PHQ9, FSFS-r, MCS at
T1, controlling for T0_MPQ-SF and – respectively - for T0_PHQ9, T0_
FSDS-r, T0_MCS (See Table 3). Our results showed no significant effect
of MCQ-30 in the prediction of PHQ9 and MCS, while a significant effect
has been found for FSDS-r. Indeed, results showed that T0_FSDS-r and
T0_MPQ inserted at block 1 explained 55% of the variance in T1_FSDS-r.
After entry T0_MCQ-30 at block 2, the total variance explained by the
model as a whole was 64%, F (3, 20) = 11.58, p < .000. Therefore,

T0_MCQ30 explained an additional 8% of the variance in sexual distress,
after controlling for FSDS-r and pain severity at T0, R2 change = .088, F
change (1, 20) = 4.83, p .04. In the whole model, both T0_FSDS-r (beta=
.755, p < .001) and T0_MCQ-30 (beta= .380, p .040) significantly predicted
subsequent sexual distress severity at T1. Conversely, in the full model,
pain severity did not predict FSDS-r at T1.
Discussion

We suggest that pain plays an important role in affecting different domains
of quality of life and mental health in women with endometriosis and
that a strict relationship between pain severity and worry trait/coping
strategies seems to exist. Furthermore, we showed that metacognitive beliefs
are significant predictors of subsequent sexual distress, over and above
previous pain severity and sexual distress score. These findings confirm
previous literature, add significant novelty to current research on this
population and lead to important clinical implications.
Pain severity matters: The impact of pain on quality of life, sexual distress
and depression

We found that women with high-pain endometriosis had the lowest physical quality of life when compared to low-pain endometriosis and control
group. Similarly, women with low-pain endometriosis showed lower physical quality of life than healthy women. Moreover, sexual distress and
depressive symptomatology were higher in women with high-pain endometriosis than in the control group. Therefore, pain symptomatology is
associated with worse physical quality of life and higher levels of sexual
distress and depressive symptomatology. Differences found between the
three groups confirmed previous studies of Cavaggioni et al. (2014),
Lorencatto et al. (2006), Souza et al. (2011) and Facchin et al. (2015).

C. ZARBO ET AL.

Indeed, in previous studies, pain has been suggested to play an important
role in affecting quality of life and mental health (e.g. depression, anxiety)
of women with endometriosis.
Moreover, even if the quality of life and depression have been widely
investigated in women with endometriosis - as well as in relation to pain
and compared to healthy population - sexual distress in this population
has been insufficiently studied. Indeed, few studies have focused on the
concept of “sexual distress” in this population. The study of Fritzer et al.
(2013) found correlations between sexual dysfunctions and sexual distress,
while the study of Zarbo et al. (2018) found no association between sexual
distress and dyspareunia or chronic pain intensity. In our study, we found
that women with high level of pain have higher sexual distress and depressive symptomatology than healthy participants. Interestingly, these differences were not found between women with low-pain and healthy ones,
as well as between high-pain and low-pain women with endometriosis.
Indeed, healthy women and women with low-pain endometriosis seem to
have similar levels of sexual distress and depressive symptomatology. Our
findings lead us to hypothesize that the severity of pain, and not the
presence of endometriosis itself, plays a key role in affecting sexual distress
and depressive symptomatology on this population.

Worry traits are related to the experience of pain

Interestingly, we found higher levels of worry traits in women with high
pain endometriosis than in those with low pain. Personality traits (and
their relationship with painful symptoms) in women with endometriosis
have been few investigated previously (Facchin et al., 2016; Gomibuchi et
al., 1993; Sepulcri & Do Amaral, 2009; Zarbo et al., 2019). The studies
of Sepulcri and Do Amaral (2009) and Zarbo et al. (2019) found a strict
relationship between anxious/worry trait and pain-intensity. Moreover,
women without dysmenorrhea seem to be less assertive compared with
women who complain of dysmenorrhea and healthy women (Gomibuchi
et al., 1993). Furthermore, women with painful endometriosis show lower
novelty seeking, exploratory excitability, and responsibility as well as higher
harm avoidance and fatigability when compared to control group or painfree endometriosis group (Facchin et al., 2016).
Our findings lead us to suggest a key role of worry traits in affecting
the experience of pain in women with endometriosis. In the last decades,
different hypotheses (cognitive and neurophysiological) have been
advanced about the link between anxiety and pain experience. According
to the biopsychosocial model of chronic pain and disability, the experience of pain is the result of a dynamic interaction between physiological,

Health Care for Women International

153

psychological, and social factors. Personality traits contribute to the
process of pain chronification by making people more vulnerable to
respond to pain in an anxious and avoidant style (Peters & Vancleef,
2008). Moreover, neurophysiological mechanisms including the role of
periaqueductal gray, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula might mediate this relationship (Wiech & Tracey, 2009).
Coping strategies and pain experience

Our results showed noteworthy differences between groups for some coping
strategies. In particular, women with high-pain endometriosis showed
higher catastrophizing than the control group. Moreover, women with
low-pain endometriosis showed lower scores on positive reappraisal and
refocus planning than the control group.
Previous findings have suggested that suppression of emotions, pain
catastrophizing and passive coping style seem to be related to higher
self-reported pain in endometriosis population (Zarbo et al., 2018). Martin
et al. (2011), Carey et al. (2014), Zarbo et al. (2019), and McPeak et al.
(2018) have previously highlighted the role of catastrophizing in affecting
pain experience in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.
Moreover, the link between catastrophizing and pain experience has
been emphasized in previous studies on different population and settings.
On this regard, former studies have suggested that catastrophizing might
have a significant impact on pain perception via a specific negative
appraisal to stimuli. According to the schema-activation model (Sullivan
et al., 2001), individuals who exaggerate the threat value of pain stimuli
or pain sensations will likely increase their attentional focus on the pain.
Indeed, catastrophizers tend to process preferentially pain-related information and interpret even ambiguous sensations as painful.
Furthermore, this is the first study that assessed a wide range of coping
strategies on women with endometriosis in relation to pain severity and
in comparison with healthy women. Interestingly, we found a deficit in
positive cognitive coping strategies (i.e. refocus planning and positive
reappraisal) in women with low-pain endometriosis than in healthy participants. However, this difference seems to be statistically low.
Metacognitive beliefs predict sexual distress after three months, over and
above pain severity

Our findings showed that, controlling for pain and sexual distress scores
at baseline, metacognitive beliefs significantly predicted sexual distress
severity after 3 months. Therefore, results suggested that cognitions and
beliefs about own worries play the most important role in predict

154

subsequent sexual distress, over and above pain severity. Our results
are similar to those found by a previous cross-sectional study of Zarbo
et al. (2018), which found that negative metacognitive beliefs were
associated to sexual distress severity, over and above dyspareunia and
chronic pain (Zarbo et al., 2018). According to the model of Wells and
Simons (2009), we can suggest that metacognitive beliefs about own
worries affect sexual distress passing through the influence on coping
strategies. In other words, beliefs about own worries may lead to a
dysfunctional way to cope with stressors (i.e. catastrophizing, ruminating
about own problems) and, indirectly, to the onset and maintenance of
distress.
Conclusions

Concluding, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case-control
longitudinal study assessing a wide range of psychological and cognitive
conditions in women with diagnosis of endometriosis. Limitations of this
study include small sample size at follow-up, short-term follow-up (i.e.
after 3 months) and lack of control for specific medical conditions (i.e.
surgery, medication, stage) occurring at T0 and between T0 and T1. These
conditions have been assessed and reported, but their control was not
possible due to the high heterogeneity of the sample and the complexity
of the disorder. Endometriosis represents a complex condition, in which
control of each of such medical categories would request a bigger sample
size and a forced-categorization of a series of variables. Furthermore, it
should be highlighted that the participants were enrolled from a single
institution, and this might reduce generalizability of our findings.
Despite these limitations, findings of this study lead us to arise significant
conclusions and clinical implications about the role of pain, worry traits,
coping strategies and metacognitive beliefs in women with endometriosis.
Indeed, despite literature is full of studies about the importance of pain in
affecting the quality of life and mental health of women with endometriosis,
this study adds significant conclusions. We can argument that the role of
pain in affecting quality of life and mental health is surely significant and
requests a specific attention from the medical team. However, we suggest
that coping strategies (in particular, catastrophizing) and worry traits could
affect the way women experience pain. Therefore, women who usually catastrophize or show worry traits are more likely to experience higher pain.
Furthermore, longitudinally, metacognitive beliefs predict sexual distress over
and above pain severity. Moreover, it should be highlighted that psychological
or sexual distress and sexual functioning may be impaired by endometriosis-associated infertility ( Laganà et al., 2016; Vitale, La Rosa, Rapisarda, &

Health Care for Women International

155

Lagana et al., 2017; Vitale et al., 2017 ), a condition not specifically investigated in this study that needs specific attention.
Important clinical implications for the medical team arise from our
study. The findings of this study are of particular importance if we consider the role of the psychologist in the multidisciplinary team for the
treatment of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a chronic and treatment-resistant condition that is usually disabling for the woman. A better understanding of the most critical psychological domains and the cognitive
processes that may modulate the impact of this disorder is crucial.
Therefore, in addition to pain assessment and treatment, the multidisciplinary team should keep into account and work on personality traits,
reinforce positive coping strategies as well as reduce negative coping strategies (i.e. catastrophizing) and metacognitive beliefs. Cognitive-Behavioral
support treatments are suggested to improve the quality of life and mental
health of women with pain-related endometriosis.
