Abstract
Objectives: Despite the need and uptake of mental health
support by women with endometriosis, no research to date
has explored their experience of psychological therapy. We
aimed to understand the factors that predict engagement in
psychological therapy by Australian women with endometriosis and to qualitative explore their experience of psychological support.
Design: Mixed-­methods design.
Methods: A total of 200 women with self-­reported endometriosis were recruited from the community. We explored;
(1) the demographic and clinical predictors of engagement
in psychological therapy, (2) the psychological approaches
that seem most valuable to women in the management of
endometriosis and (3) their experience engaging in psychological therapy for endometriosis.
Results: Nearly half of women reported to have seen a psychologist within the past year, particularly for pain. Younger
age (OR, .94; 95% CI, .886–.993), depressive symptoms
(OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.002–1.099), and working part time
compared to full time (OR, 2.17, 95% CI, 1.012–4.668), increased the likelihood of engaging in psychological therapy.
Template thematic analysis identified three themes; (1) endometriosis and pain have multi-­faceted psychological effects, (2) psychological support is sought to adjust and live
with endometriosis and (3) there are helpful and unhelpful
psychological tools for women with endometriosis.
Conclusions: Our findings support the use of psychological therapy in the management of endometriosis, and the

Statement of Contribution
What is already known on this subject?
• Endometriosis is a common chronic disease that can affect a broad range of psychological
factors.
• A top research priority is management strategies to address the emotional and psychological
impacts of the disease.
• Psychological support is commonly sought to manage and/or alleviate symptoms of the
disease.
What does this study add?
• Psychological therapy aids in understanding the psychological effects of endometriosis and
pain.
• Learning how to adjust to and live with a chronic disease is key aspect of psychological
therapy for endometriosis.
• Psychologists should consider individual needs, alternative therapeutic options and engage
multidisciplinary when working with this population.

I N T RODUC T ION
Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the growth of endometrial-­l ike tissue
outside the uterus, affecting one in nine Australian women by the age of 44 years ( Johnson et al., 2017;
Rowlands et al., 2020). Women report fatigue, bloating, nausea, abdominal and lower back pain,
with dysmenorrhea (period pain) and fertility issues being reported as most distressing (Van Niekerk
et al., 2022). Endometriosis-­related symptoms, and in particular, persistent pelvic pain (PPP; pelvic pain
lasting over 6 months) affects more than 60% of those diagnosed (Ballard et al., 2008) and can substantially impact psychosocial functioning (Culley et al., 2013). Many women report mental health concerns,
restricted activity, productivity loss, financial burden and reduced quality of life and well-­being, relative
to those without endometriosis (Della Corte et al., 2020).
One of the top research priorities identified by both women with endometriosis and healthcare
professionals is the discovery and testing of new treatments and management strategies (including
non-­medical and self-­management methods) to address the emotional and psychological impact of the
disease (Horne et al., 2017). Women report a broad range of psychological factors impacted by endometriosis, including reduced self-­esteem and self-­confidence, lack of control over daily life (powerlessness),
interference with identity and gender roles, dissatisfaction with body appearance (e.g., scars, weight
gain), feelings of uncertainty (e.g., recurrence of disease, future fertility, employability) and symptoms

of anxiety and depression (Moradi et al., 2014). As such, many women are concerned about the contribution of psychological and stress-­related factors on symptoms of endometriosis and seek psychological
support to reduce and/or alleviate their symptoms (Márki et al., 2022). An Australian study found that
21% of women with endometriosis (n = 340) accessed a mental health worker and spent the second most
cumulative cost on psychological support ($7555 on average in the previous two months), compared to
other allied health and complementary therapies (Malik et al., 2022). Based on current usage and the
significant cost burden associated, research on the effectiveness of psychological therapy needs to be
prioritised (Malik et al., 2022).
Clinical guidelines for endometriosis recognize the importance of psychologists as part of a collaborative, multidisciplinary care approach to improve patient outcomes (Dunselman et al., 2014;
NICE, 2017; RANZCOG, 2021). Psychologists can work across the gamut of pain management, providing specialized support to reduce symptoms of emotional and functional distress, manage comorbid mental health conditions, assess for ‘yellow flags’, such as psychological factors known to predict
poorer outcomes (e.g., pain catastrophizing) and formulate presenting concerns to inform care planning
(Australian Pain Society, 2021). Mental health clinicians working with PPP often utilize mindfulness,
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT), and in line with
the chronic pain evidence base, consider CBT and ACT as the most effective in managing presenting
concerns (e.g., chronic pain) and comorbid conditions (e.g., generalized anxiety disorder [GAD], major
depressive disorder [MDD] and post-­t raumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) (Brooks et al., 2021; Williams
et al., 2020). However, clinicians report several difficulties in treating this population, where clients
struggle to challenge pain-­related beliefs, demonstrate preoccupations with pain and/or pain avoidance, possess maladaptive coping skills and experience difficulties with acceptance (Brooks et al., 2021).
A third of clinicians expressed uncertainty about which interventions were most evidence based for
women with PPP (n = 29, 34.5%) (Brooks et al., 2021).
Despite the espoused importance of psychological support for women with endometriosis, pathways
to psychological care are complex. For example, general practitioners (GPs) and gynaecologists, who are
usually the first point of contact for women with suspected endometriosis (Lamvu et al., 2020), are important referral points to psychological support. Yet, health professionals may minimize psychological
impacts of the disease and thus delay referral, or not refer at all, to specialist support (Rowe et al., 2019).
As such, women report having missed multidisciplinary support in the follow-­up and/or treatment of
endometriosis, and in particular, from psychologists (n = 775, 89%), with 42.4% of women stating they
need psychologists to a very large degree (Omtvedt et al., 2022).
Complicating matters, stigma concerns associated with seeking psychological therapy for pain are
likely doubly present in those with endometriosis (Australian Psychological Society, 2020). Beyond such
stigma associated with seeking therapy for pain in general, several studies exploring endometriosis-­
related stigma argue that the shame and secrecy around menstruation may lead to the concealment
or reluctance to seek support around the management of or adjustment to irregularities experienced
in relation to endometriosis, such as PPP, heavy bleeding, or painful menstruation (Seear, 2009; Sims
et al., 2021). Symptom concealment seems particularly evident by women whose subjective experiences
of debilitating symptoms are trivialized, redefined or normalized by others as a burden expected to be
carried by women (Seear, 2009). Sims et al. (2021) suggest that a lack of awareness about endometriosis
by healthcare professionals likely perpetuates stigmatization and poorer psychosocial well-­being and
may impact women's engagement in care.
A significant gap in the current literature relates to the perspectives of women with endometriosis seeking psychological support and a fuller understanding of what predicts access to psychological therapies for these women. By understanding the barriers associated with psychological care
for endometriosis, it is possible to increase the engagement in, and acceptability of psychological
treatments provided, and potentially develop clearer pathways to psychological care for women with
endometriosis. Importantly, collaboration with people affected by endometriosis is central to improving the experiences of and outcomes for these individuals, their families, partners and carers,
and greater cooperation between key partners (e.g., governmental sector, research institutions, allied

health services) can lead to more beneficial individual and system outcomes (Australian Government
Department of Health, 2018).
Thus, the present mixed-­methods study aimed to explore psychological treatment approaches in
endometriosis, including (1) the quantitative demographic (age, education level, employment status)
and clinical (depression, anxiety, stress, pain catastrophizing, functional pain disability, menstrual
pain) predictors of engagement in psychological therapy, (2) the psychological approaches perceived
to be most valuable to women in the management of pain and mental health for endometriosis and
(3) a qualitative exploration of women's experiences engaging in psychological therapy for endometriosis and pain.

Design
This cross-­sectional mixed-­methods study is part of the Biopsychological Impact of Pelvic Pain on
Australian Women cohort study examining the well-­being of individuals with dysmenorrhea and endometriosis. The current study examined a subset of quantitative and qualitative data collected from the
first (May to June 2019, baseline) and second ( June to August 2020, follow-­up) wave of data collection
from a total of three waves. A mixed-­methods design enabled triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data to enhance our understanding of women's engagement in psychological therapy for endometriosis (Foss & Ellefsen, 2002). Ethics approval was obtained prior to recruitment from the Human
Ethics Advisory Group at Deakin University (HEAG-­H 10_2019).

Participants
The target population of the current study was in line with the inclusion criteria of the larger pelvic
pain study; Women aged between 18 and 50 years, who self-­reported menses within the past 12 months
and were living in Australia. Women were included if they reported a diagnosis of endometriosis. To
confirm the presence of endometriosis, participants were asked: ‘have you ever received a diagnosis of
endometriosis?’, a method which has been used in previous studies (Fuldeore & Soliman, 2017) and to
report the diagnostic method used.

Recruitment
An online questionnaire link was distributed via social media (e.g., women's gyms, Facebook groups)
using the study advertisement flyer in 2019, which invited women to participate in a brief survey to
understand how their periods affect overall well-­being. Informed consent was obtained prior to the
baseline survey. Participants who completed the baseline survey and agreed to participate in the longitudinal cohort study, were sent a follow-­up questionnaire link via email in June 2020. The online questionnaire was created using Qualtrics (www.​qualt​rics.​com) and took approximately 30 min to complete.
Participants were offered the chance to win 1 of 10 $50 vouchers.

Data collection
A comprehensive survey was developed by the study researchers to address the study aims. Demographic
information and clinical measures were collected at baseline. Health information, psychological therapy
engagement and experiences of psychological therapy were collected at follow-­up.

Quantitative measures
Demographic information
Basic demographic information included participant age, ethnicity(s), education level, employment status, marital status and parous status.
Clinical measures
Pain catastrophizing. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) was used to assess helplessness, rumination
and magnification in one's ability to deal with pain using a 0 (not at all) to 4 (all the time) scale (Sullivan
et al., 1995). The three subscale scores were summed to calculate a total pain catastrophizing score
(Sullivan et al., 1995), with a higher score indicating a greater level of pain catastrophizing. The PCS
demonstrated excellent internal consistency in the first wave of data collection (α = .93). A total score
above 30 is classified as clinically relevant (Sullivan, 2009).
Depression, anxiety and stress. The Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-­21) was used to assess
symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress, using a 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me
most of the time) scale (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). The three subscale scores of depression, anxiety
and stress were calculated, with higher score indicating a greater level of the associated symptom. The
DASS-­21 demonstrated excellent internal consistency in the first wave of data collection (α = .93).
Subscale scores were categorized as mild, moderate, severe or extremely severe using the DASS-­21 scale
manual (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995).
Functional pain disability. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) was used to assess interference of pain on
physical functioning within the past 24 h, using an 11-­point scale from 0 (does not interfere) to 10
(completely interferes) (Cleeland & Ryan, 1994). The BPI consists of seven pain interference items
assessing how much pain has interfered with seven daily activities: general activity, walking, work, mood,
enjoyment of life, relations with others and sleep; Higher scores indicate greater pain interference and
functional pain disability (Dworkin et al., 2008). The BPI demonstrated excellent internal consistency
in the first wave of data collection (α = .93).
Menstrual pain severity. Participants were asked to rate: ‘what is your usual level of pain during your
period (without pain medicine)?’ using the 0 (none) to 10 (worst) Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) to
measure menstrual pain severity. Consistent with previous studies, the NRS was categorized as mild
(1–4), moderate (5–7), or severe (8–10) (Boonstra et al., 2016; Suvitie et al., 2016).

Health information
Health-­related information included contraceptive use (yes/no), method of diagnosis, pain duration
(years), chronic illness status (yes/no), general practitioner visits and days missed of school or work in
the past year.
Psychological therapy engagement
Participants were asked if they had seen a psychologist in the previous year (yes/no), and if yes,
participants were then asked if the visit was in relation to pain and/or period pain (yes/no). All
participants were asked whether they would be interested in a professionally designed program for
period pain and psychological well-­being (yes/no) and to select typical psychological approaches
they would find most valuable, including: ‘exploring the links between thoughts and behaviours
to improve emotions’ (CBT), ‘guidance to a state of deep relaxation and responding to suggestions
for change’ (hypnosis), ‘focusing attention on the present moment and turning to this focus when
distracted’ (mindfulness), ‘using peaceful, soothing or symbolic imagery to enhance relaxation’ (imagery), ‘accepting what is out of personal control and committing to actions that improve day-­to-­day
life’ (ACT), and other (free-­text response).

ENDOMETRIOSIS AND ENGAGEMENT IN THERAPY

|   

DOWDING et al .

Qualitative measures
Experience of psychological therapy
Participants who had visited a psychologist in the past year were asked to describe their experience and
what they did in therapy using a free-­text response question; participants were asked, ‘If so, can you
describe your experience and what you did in therapy’ and submitted a free-­text response (58/85, 68%).
Responses ranged from 1 to 72 words.

Data analysis
Quantitative
The study sample was characterized using descriptive statistics, including means, standard deviations
(SD) and frequencies (%), and analysed using SPSS Version 26. A binary logistic regression was used to
explore the demographic and clinical predictors of engagement in psychological therapy (yes/no) in the
previous 12 months. The independent variables for engagement included: age, education level, employment status, depression, anxiety, stress, pain catastrophizing, functional pain disability and menstrual
pain. Only factors significantly related to therapy engagement were included in the final logic regression
model. The two-­sided significance level was set at .05.

Qualitative
A descriptive theoretical framework was applied to understand Australian women's engagement in psychological therapy for endometriosis, and a descriptive, inductive approach was taken, where the data
guided the development of themes. A critical realist (CR) approach was applied; A CR approach argues
that researchers are not independent of their perspective but recognize that there is a reality to observe
and describe (Clarke & Braun, 2013). Qualitative data was analysed using template thematic analysis to
identify patterns of meaning across texts (Brooks et al., 2015), following the main procedural steps: (1)
familiarization with the transcripts, through the process of transcription and re-­reading the data; (2)
preliminary data coding; (3) the organization of emerging themes into clusters; (4) the development of
an initial coding template; (5) application of the final template to the full dataset; and (6) refinement
of the themes to inform the research question and literature. Double coding was undertaken by the
research team (AMW, SE, MO) to bring a variety of perspectives to the data and to ensure consensus
on themes, with any differences in opinion resolved within the research team.
Methodological triangulation was used to gain a comprehensive understanding of study aims. The
quantitative and qualitative methods were conducted simultaneously, and the findings used to complement each other, as a way of gaining a more holistic interpretation of engagement in and experiences of
psychological therapy for endometriosis (Arias Valencia, 2022).

Reflexive statement
The primary researcher draws on knowledge from working with and researching endometriosis populations, as well as undertaking a Doctor of Clinical Psychology, which comes with both benefits and
limitations. This may have enhanced understanding of endometriosis-­related and psychological terms,
however, may have also assumed meaning to participant responses. To ensure reflexivity, notes were
kept at each stage of analysis, particularly when codes or themes were drawing on prior knowledge or
experience, and/or were changed, and shared with the research team. Additionally, we enhanced trustworthiness by engaging in debriefing sessions with the research team and presenting representative
textual data of the themes in the results.

Participant characteristics
As shown in Table 1, the current study includes 200 women, aged between 18 and 49 (mean = 29.3,
SD = 7.02), who self-­reported a diagnosis of endometriosis. Most participants had completed a bachelor's degree, were married and employed full time. Nearly half of women reported a chronic illness
other than endometriosis (43%), mostly being irritable bowel syndrome (32.6%) and fibromyalgia
(12.8%). Most women presented with mild–moderate depression (M = 13.4, SD = 10.3), moderate anxiety (M = 13.4, SD = 8.5) and mild–moderate stress (M = 18.6, SD = 9.6), clinically relevant levels of pain
catastrophizing (M = 30.1, SD = 11.5) and moderate–severe menstrual pain severity (M = 7.8, SD =1.6).
On average, participants reported seven visits to a general practitioner or specialist and were absent on
13 days from work or school in the past year.

Engagement in psychological therapy and valuable approaches
As shown in Table 2, nearly half of women reported to have seen a psychologist over the past year
(N = 85/200, 42.5%), particularly for pain (N = 31/85, 36.5%). Most women who completed the survey were interested in a professionally designed program for pain and psychological well-­
being
(N = 153/200, 76.5%), and reported interest in techniques associated with ACT (N = 128/200, 64%),
CBT (N = 102/200, 51%) and hypnosis (N = 101/200, 50.5%).

Predictors of engagement in psychological therapy
As shown in Table 3, the logistic model was significant, χ2(13, N = 197) = 35.61, p = <.001, suggesting
that it could distinguish between those who did and did not engage in psychological therapy. Women
presenting with depressive symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 1.05; confidence interval [CI], 1.002–1.099;
p = .042) were slightly more likely to engage in therapy, whilst those of younger age were slightly less
likely (OR, .94; CI, .886–.993; p = .029), compared those who did not engage in psychological therapy.
Women who were part time employed had 2.17 times the odds of engaging in psychological therapy
(OR, 2.17; CI, 1.012–4.668; p = .047), compared to those who were full time employed. Education level,
anxiety, stress, functional pain disability, pain catastrophizing and menstrual pain did not significantly
predict engagement in psychological therapy.

Experiences of psychological therapy
We derived three themes relating to, (1) the multi-­faceted psychological effects of endometriosis and
pain, (2) the use of psychological support to adjust to and live with endometriosis and (3) the helpful
psychological tools and barriers to engagement for women with endometriosis.

Theme 1 Endometriosis and pain have multi-­faceted psychological effects
Women reported a range of psychological effects from endometriosis and pain, with several types of
pain reported, including period pain, endometriosis pain, pelvic pain, dyspareunia and chronic pain.
Women who sought psychological support in relation to pain and/or period pain reported comorbid
symptoms of anxiety and depression, stress, dissatisfaction with body appearance, sleep issues, trauma
and fears/uncertainty for the future. These women discussed the impact of endometriosis-­related

ENDOMETRIOSIS AND ENGAGEMENT IN THERAPY

|   

DOWDING et al .

symptoms (e.g., pain, muscle tension) on their levels of anxiety and mood, and vice versa; ‘pain makes
me anxious and low mood’, ‘how to deal with the feelings that were brought on by the pain’ and ‘working on coping with anxiety, relaxing my pelvic floor as I tense there when anxious’.
For women who reported that period pain and/or pain was not the trigger for psychological support,
they identified several reasons for seeking therapy, such as psychological diagnoses (e.g., depression,
anxiety, PTSD, post-­natal depression, post-­partum psychosis) and/or everyday stressors (e.g., workplace
stress). Despite the therapy being ‘not specifically for pelvic pain’, some reflected that endometriosis
and pain continued to enter the therapy space ‘as an aside’ and explored the impact of endometriosis
and pain on their psychological well-­being: ‘Treatment for anxiety and depression. We discussed endo
in passing and how to deal with the added pressures it creates’. Uncertainty about what the future may
hold was also noted by these women. One participant discussed this with respect to surgical treatment
for endometriosis, ‘we have talked about the uncertainty surrounding a future laparoscopy, and how
surgery may or may not be helpful and/or fix the pain’, whilst another noted uncertainty in terms of
future fertility, and its impact on self-­worth and role identity, ‘the fact that my endometriosis has caused
low fertility has also driven me to therapy for low self-­esteem as I've always wanted to have my own kids
and I'm not sure if I can’.
Several women reported to seek psychological support for trauma-­related concerns (n = 6), including
PTSD, with one woman identifying endometriosis as the main cause of trauma: ‘I had a bad flare up
after a recent laser lap & went to my psych for PTSD counselling in regards to the trauma experienced
from endo and all its co-­conditions’.
Others acknowledged the likely contribution of endometriosis to experiences of grief and loss: ‘It was
for an IVF pregnancy loss – so probably attributable in the long term to my endo diagnosis, but not for
period pain specifically’, and ‘pain did come up in my sessions as it does effect most aspects of my life. I
am undergoing therapy due to PTSD, as well as grief’. The feeling of loss was also discussed in respect
to being diagnosed with endometriosis, a lifelong chronic illness. As such, women described engaging
in therapy to process the loss of identity and ability in life and to adjust psychologically to these changes:
‘Talked about the loss of identity and ability in my life due to the chronic illness. Discussed the difficulty
in adjusting mentally and physically to the poorer quality of life I experience’.

Theme 2 Psychological therapy was sought to adjust to and live with endometriosis
Most often, women reported that psychological therapy was sought to manage the chronicity of symptoms and understand the impact of endometriosis on everyday life; ‘I visit them to help manage my
chronic illness/pain. They help me with tools to get through day-­to-­day life’. Women described psychological therapy as a process of ‘coming to terms’ with the diagnosis and its long-­term consequences;
‘learning to cope with the reality of endometriosis and how it will affect my life for a long time’. In
doing so, therapy seemed to encourage ‘accepting’ and ‘adjusting’ to symptoms of endometriosis. This
involved exploring the ‘pervasive effects’ of endometriosis-­related symptoms on work, relationships,
social engagements, daily routine and sense of self, whilst also discussing how to maintain everyday
activities despite this; ‘worked through dealing with endo pain on a daily basis and making it normal
with my life and accepting this dramatic change in my life’.
Even for women who sought psychological therapy for reasons other than endometriosis, the condition was often included in therapeutic discussions as being relevant to presenting concerns; ‘talk about
my everyday struggles, sometimes the talk is in relation to my endometriosis, but not always’ and ‘I see
a psychologist to mostly discuss coping strategies at work as a healthcare professional, managing situational anxiety and stress. There are some consults where endometriosis and my coping strategies are
discussed and explored.’ In this sense, therapy seemed to develop an increased awareness of endometriosis as a contributing factor to mental ill-­health and overall quality of life: ‘I suffer from depression and
endometriosis is a contributing factor so we examine the impact it has had on my life’. This also included

situational stress, intimacy, grief and pregnancy loss: ‘Discussed coping strategies and the effect my
pelvic pain has on my relationship’.

Theme 3 There are helpful psychological tools and barriers to engagement for women
with endometriosis
Women reported a range of helpful psychological tools employed by psychologists to address presenting
concerns. Most notably, women learnt mindfulness techniques to manage the physical symptoms of endometriosis: ‘I see my therapist regularly and we talk mindfulness techniques to cope with the pain’ and sought
psychological support specifically for this reason: ‘Because I am experiencing such pain, at such a young
age, I have a lot of fears for the future and I was looking to go over strategies to help calm that anxiety and
address those fears head on. I also wanted some more strategies to work through my physical pain from
the psychological side – more mindfulness techniques’. Mindfulness techniques included breathing and
grounding techniques, and used in conjunction with CBT, ACT and dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)
skills, were reportedly beneficial for both physical and psychological effects of endometriosis.
Several women described the usefulness of CBT to explore the link between pain and mental ill-­
health; ‘pain makes me anxious and low mood. Using CBT to help with this’. Additionally, ACT-­based
approaches and self-­compassion techniques, such as reflecting on attitudes towards oneself, cultivating
acceptance and noticing resistance to change, seemed helpful in reducing the impact of symptoms,
building one's self-­esteem and worth and increasing acceptance to their current level of functioning;
‘learning to cope with the pain and to not always be angry at my body for not being able to do things’
and ‘we talked about the fact that I am worth more than what I can do for others’. Importantly, women
benefited from a client-­centred approach, particularly from clinicians who provided ‘validation’, ‘supportive’ and ‘open’ discussion especially with respect to pain by validating that ‘the pain was real’ and
that ‘it's okay not to be okay’.
Further to this, women reported benefits to trying alternative approaches, particularly when other
options were no longer helpful: ‘regular talking therapy didn't help at all but a new therapist has introduced me to tapping and it's been phenomenal in helping me cope.’ and ‘it was gut hypnotherapy to help
me manage my nausea which is made worse due to periods and endo’. Women also sought support from
psychologists to discuss major life decisions impacted by endometriosis: ‘[I] visited psych to speak about
pain etc, and be signed off as being of sound mind to make the decision to proceed with hysterectomy
at a young age’.
However, women also noted several barriers to engaging with ongoing psychological therapy, including therapist and modality related issues and service-­related issues. A small number reported no
benefit at all (n = 2). One significant concern raised by several women was a perceived lack of therapist
knowledge and expertise in managing chronic conditions: ‘I have several years ago attempted to seek
therapy for coping with chronic severe pain, when my endometriosis was at its worse, and found the
mental health professionals ill-­equipped to deal with my situation’. Some women described not finding
the ‘right person’, particularly in the context of alliance issues, where the psychologist was viewed to
explore irrelevant/unhelpful concerns (e.g., finding a boyfriend, living out of home) or perceived the
therapy as an unsatisfactory process: ‘I didn't click with the psychologist, I tried again with a different
psychologist at the practise. I found it was a very basic process of me talking about the issues I had and
then being asked to elaborate’. Others were ambivalent about its usefulness: ‘Didn't help much but was
nice to open up to someone about it’.
As such, women described an overarching need for psychological therapy to be more than just ‘regular talking therapy’, highlighting the importance of building a biopsychosocial formulation to guide
treatment and referral to multidisciplinary support: ‘[I] have a lot of pain with penetrative intercourse
so required pelvic physio as well as psychological intervention to assist me in retraining my brains perception of pain and waiting for something to actually hurt before my brain tells me it's hurting. This
was very helpful’.

ENDOMETRIOSIS AND ENGAGEMENT IN THERAPY

|   

DOWDING et al .

Finally, service-­related issues were reported, including a lack of specialist availability and disruptions
to continuity of care, speaking to the wider issues of endometriosis-­related care in Australia: ‘I visited a
pain psychologist once and she took a history. Unfortunately, she was so booked up I struggled to get a
second appointment so I started seeing a general psychologist’.

DIS C US SION
Women's engagement in, and views of, psychological therapy in this mixed-­methods study reveal novel
insights about the use of psychological therapy for endometriosis. Nearly half of women surveyed
sought psychological support. Women indicated various reasons for psychological therapy, including
endometriosis-­related symptom management, mental health support, trauma counselling and support
in navigating their identity and self-­concept. Regardless, a majority of women reported exploring the
psychological effects of endometriosis and pain during psychological therapy, and found learning how
to adjust to and live with a chronic disease beneficial.
Depression is one of the most common comorbid psychological disorders in endometriosis (Pope
et al., 2015), with prevalence estimates of around 29% in this population (Delanerolle et al., 2021).
Similarly, a majority of women in our study reported mild to moderate symptoms of depression. As
anticipated, these women were marginally more likely to have sought support from a psychologist than
women who did not report depressive symptoms. Symptoms of depression, such as hopelessness, worthlessness and persistent feelings of sadness, are known to influence pain perception and quality of life in
endometriosis (Laganà et al., 2017). The relatively minor influence of depression on predicting women
with endometriosis's engagement with psychological care leaves it unclear as to how depression amongst
women with endometriosis influences their pathway to care.
Other clinical features (stress, anxiety, pain catastrophizing, functional pain disability and pain severity) were unrelated to engagement with a psychologist. An Australian study found that those with
higher pelvic pain scores (on average) had an increased likelihood of using prescription medication for
endometriosis, with opiate-­based pain medication being the most commonly used (O'Hara et al., 2020).
Opioids, however, are not recommended by clinical guidelines to manage endometriosis pain due to
their limited efficacy and potential to execrate the problem (e.g., chronic use, higher healthcare utilization) (Becker et al., 2022; Chiuve et al., 2021). The degree to which women with endometriosis are
informed about the benefits of psychological versus pharmacological treatment is worthy of further
investigation.
In contrast to some clinical features of endometriosis, the employment status of women in our
study did influence whether or not they had engaged in psychological treatment. Those women
working part time were twice as likely to access psychological therapy than those who were employed full time. Importantly, a longitudinal study of Australian women (n = 4, 994) found that 63%
of women with endometriosis were working full time before diagnosis and 44% remained in full-­
time work after diagnosis (Rowlands et al., 2022). Thus, whilst the chronic and recurrent nature of
endometriosis can lead to high absenteeism and lower employment (Rossi et al., 2021), many women
with endometriosis continue to hold down full-­t ime employment. As such, the psychological well-­
being of women with endometriosis needs to be adequately supported in the workplace. In Australia
and the United Kingdom, employers have a legal obligation to support the potential disability caused
by endometriosis in the workplace (Endometriosis UK, n.d.; Safe Work Australia, 2019). Armour
et al. (2022) found that many women, however, report feeling judged when trying to manage symptoms at work (64%, n = 389) and are ‘hiding’ symptom management from their employees or employers. Psychology and counselling programs and mindfulness programs were identified as extremely
or very important workplace initiatives by women with endometriosis amongst other things (e.g.,
flexible working arrangements, rest periods, physical aids) (Armour et al., 2022). Further to this,
the availability of treatment (e.g., opening hours, wait periods, appointment times) and lack of time,
which are barriers to accessing psychological therapy for pain (Australian Pain Society, 2020), may

be particularly relevant for women working full time. Women with endometriosis would likely
benefit from additional workplace support (e.g., time off, flexible work arrangements, Employee
Assistance Programs) to ensure they can access psychological therapy, whilst also feel supported in
their workplace to share and discuss their disease more comfortably.
Qualitative findings from this study yielded further insights regarding the experience of psychological treatment for women who received it, as well as the primary concerns they sought support for.
Overall, women in this study reflected that endometriosis and pain impacted multiple life domains:
their sense of identity, plans for the future, everyday activities and interpersonal relationships – which
likely contributed to increased distress and subsequent referral to psychological support.
Trauma-­related issues were emphasized by women in this study as concerns that psychological therapy was able to address and explore. Endometriosis has been linked to a history of trauma (Harris
et al., 2018), and those with chronic pain conditions are four times more likely to develop PTSD compared to individuals without a chronic pain condition (McWilliams et al., 2003). Several women in this
study identified PTSD as being the main reason for engaging in psychological therapy, and endometriosis was noted as a contributing factor to the development of PTSD. This may be in part due to the often-­
intense patient journey as reported by women in the current study and others (Facchin et al., 2018),
which can include physical and emotional suffering, traumatizing hospitalisations and negative experiences with healthcare professionals. Unprocessed trauma is, therefore, a common target for treatment in
women with PPP (65.2%); however, clinicians have highlighted that further evidence for trauma therapies in this population is needed (Brooks et al., 2021). Psychological therapies including eye movement
desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and CBT are considered effective for treating PTSD (Cukor
et al., 2010); however, it is not yet known which therapies consistently address co-­occurring PTSD and
endometriosis-­related concerns (e.g., PPP) (Goldstein et al., 2019). Further research into trauma therapies for endometriosis is required to appropriately treat women when these two conditions co-­occur.
Alongside revealing key issues of focus in psychological therapy, women in this study also spoke
about what was helpful in these spaces. Women described the usefulness of fostering kindness and
compassion towards themselves and their bodies, as well as learning to respect their physical limitations.
Self-­compassion can be defined as being caring and kind towards oneself and acknowledging that suffering, failure and inadequacy is a normal part of the human experience (Neff, 2003). Self-­compassion
has emerged as a clinically relevant factor in the psychological treatment of endometriosis (Van Niekerk
et al., 2022), and systematic reviews of compassionate mind training and self-­compassion-­based therapy (SCT) have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing symptoms of depression and anxiety in
chronic health conditions (Austin et al., 2021; Kılıç et al., 2021). Our findings support the inclusion of
self-­compassion techniques in psychological therapy for women with endometriosis.
A key advantage of psychological therapy reported by women was adjusting to and living with the
reality of endometriosis as a lifelong, chronic illness. This was characterized by women learning how to
accept the chronicity of endometriosis by recognizing its impact on everyday life. ACT-­based techniques,
such as acceptance, present focus awareness (e.g., mindfulness), valued direction and committed action,
that focus on functional-­related outcomes (e.g., work, relationships, social engagements, daily routine),
rather than amelioration of symptoms, were well-­suited to this population. In line with this, a 12-­week
intervention of ACT in combination with mindfulness-­based stress reduction (MBSR) for women with
endometriosis (n = 19) significantly increased pain acceptance, pain willingness, activity engagement
and work ability, whilst had no effect on pain intensity post-­intervention (Hansen et al., 2023). ACT
techniques may also be helpful in regaining a sense of identity distinct from self as chronically ill and/or
typical gender ‘roles’ (e.g., child bearer). Our results provide further support for ACT and mindfulness-­
based therapies in the management endometriosis (Moreira et al., 2022; Van Niekerk et al., 2019), and
large-­scale trials assessing functional and symptom-­based outcomes are warranted.
In addition, women found exploring the link between pain and mental ill-­health beneficial, and over
half were interested in a professionally designed program utilizing CBT-­based techniques to improve
emotions. Previous research supports the use of CBT for endometriosis-­related pain and psychological
distress (Donatti et al., 2022; Van Niekerk et al., 2019); however, clear evidence-­based protocols and

DOWDING et al .

randomized controlled trials are required for the inclusion of CBT as an evidence-­based recommendation in clinical guidelines for endometriosis. Despite this, research has shown that women with endometriosis view CBT as a potential asset to improving quality of life, and in particular, believe group-­based
CBT could increase peer-­support and their connection to others (Boersen et al., 2021). In view of
current findings, well-­controlled studies exploring treatment satisfaction and experiences of CBT for
women with endometriosis is of high importance.
Importantly, women reported that they benefited from psychologists who were attuned to their
needs, enlisted multidisciplinary care and considered alternative approaches to improve symptom management. They endorsed psychologists who validated symptoms, especially pain, and supported them
to make decisions aligned with their needs (e.g., hysterectomy at a young age). Research suggests that
patient satisfaction with endometriosis care is impacted by three factors: 1) information provided meets
patient needs, 1) being heard with empathy and respect, and the technical competence of healthcare
professionals (Rowe et al., 2019). Yet, most studies exploring how women view endometriosis care focus
on clinical care provided by GPs, rather than other allied health professionals deemed important by
women in their care (Pettersson & Berterö, 2020; Rowe et al., 2019). Physiotherapy, hypnotherapy and
tapping provided symptom relief for women in the current study, particularly when standard treatments
were no longer effective. Women have requested further explanations of available treatment options
(Rowe et al., 2019), and alongside support for engagement and referral by their GP, will likely improve
treatment experiences and outcomes in endometriosis.

Limitations
There are several study limitations worth noting. Our qualitative analysis was based on one open-­
ended question and, therefore, may be limited in scope. Although the question was specifically designed
to expand our knowledge on participant experiences of psychological therapy, future research should
consider using semi-­structured interviews to delve more deeply into participant experiences, attitudes,
perceptions and barriers to engagement with a psychologist, and to explore the personal benefits and
issues of specific treatment modalities (DeJonckheere & Vaughn, 2019). A further limitation is the self-­
reported diagnosis of endometriosis in our sample of women; however, research suggests that there are
high confirmation rates against medical records in this population (Shafrir et al., 2021). In addition,
the majority of participants were highly educated Caucasian women, and thus, further research into the
experiences of culturally, linguistically and gender diverse people and those of lower socioeconomic in
psychological therapy for endometriosis is required, particularly given the increased likelihood of disparate health outcomes in these populations (Harrison et al., 2020; Strauss et al., 2017).

C ONC LUSIONS
The current study provides support for psychological intervention in the management of women
with endometriosis and novel insights into the key aspects of therapy that benefit this population.
Women were receptive to self-­compassion-­, acceptance-­and mindfulness-­based techniques, and
further randomized controlled trials investigating SCT, ACT, MBSR and CBT with an adequate
sample size are required. Most importantly, women benefited from psychologists who considered
their specific needs, encouraged alternative options and engaged multidisciplinary support, particularly when first-­l ine treatments were no longer effective. Further advocacy is required by healthcare
professionals to educate women on the benefits of psychological therapy to manage psychosocial
impacts of the disease. Future research should consider which aspects of psychological interventions
improve outcomes, particularly in the presence of co-­occurring PTSD and endometriosis, consider
key barriers to engagement and assess treatment satisfaction in psychological therapy for women
with endometriosis.
