The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of mental health outcomes in women in the United
States with and without documented endometriosis. In a retrospective matched-cohort study using administrative
health claims data from Optum’s Clinformatics DataMart from May 1, 2000, through March 31, 2019, women aged
18–50 years with endometriosis (n = 72,677), identified by International Classiﬁcation of Disease diagnosis codes
(revisions 9 or 10), were matched 1:2 on age and calendar time to women without endometriosis (n = 147,251),
with a median follow-up of 529 days (interquartile range, 195, 1,164). The rate per 1,000 person-years of anxiety,
depression, and self-directed violence among women with endometriosis was 57.1, 47.7, and 0.9, respectively.
Comparing women with endometriosis to those without, the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals
were 1.38 (1.34, 1.42) for anxiety, 1.48 (1.44, 1.53) for depression, and 2.03 (1.60, 2.58) for self-directed violence.
The association with depression was stronger among women younger than 35 years (P for heterogeneity <
0.01). Risk factors for incident depression, anxiety, and self-directed violence among women with endometriosis
included endometriosis-related pain symptoms and prevalence of other chronic conditions associated with pain.
The identification of risk factors for mental health conditions among women with endometriosis may improve
patient-centered disease management.

Endometriosis is a common chronic gynecological condition, affecting approximately 10% of women of reproductive
age (1, 2). Although some patients are asymptomatic, common clinical manifestations of endometriosis may include
chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, dyschezia,
dysuria, and infertility (3, 4). In part because of the range
of symptoms, diagnosis of endometriosis is often delayed
(5), resulting in delayed treatment, which negatively affects
patients’ quality of life (6).
Major depressive disorder and anxiety affect 10% to
20% of US adults (7, 8), with women at double the risk
of men (7). Furthermore, depression and anxiety disorders
are risk factors for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts
(9, 10). The increased risk of depression and anxiety
among endometriosis patients has been reported in several
studies. (11–13) Endometriosis may be associated with

mental health disorders through shared biologic pathways
such as chronic inflammation or through mediation by
chronic pain symptoms (14, 15). The prevalence of anxiety
and depression is high in patients who suffer from other
forms of chronic pain, such as chronic pelvic pain (16),
low back pain (17), and migraines (18), and in a recent
meta-analysis, authors suggested the association between
endometriosis and depressive symptoms is mediated largely through chronic pain (19). However, the majority of
existing studies looking at prevalence and incidence of
mental health disorders among patients with endometriosis
have several limitations, including cross-sectional design,
small sample size (<50 patients), and data not being representative of the overall patient population, such as youth
or inclusion of regional clinical data only (16). In addition,
little is known about the risk of self-directed violence and

heterogeneity of these associations among select subgroups
of patients.
Identifying women at high-risk for mental health conditions may improve patient-centered disease management
and inform the selection of treatment approaches in this
population. Thus, the objective of our study was to use
data representative of the care provided to US patients with
endometriosis to evaluate incidence of depression, anxiety,
and suicide attempts after the diagnosis of endometriosis
in a large sample of patients. We also identified risk factors for these mental health conditions among women with
endometriosis.

Study design and data source

We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative health claims from the Clinformatics Data Mart
database (Optum, Inc., Eden Prairie, Minnesota) from May
1, 2000, through March 31, 2019. This database contains
adjudicated, adjusted, and deidentified medical and outpatient pharmacy claims for approximately 87.4 million beneficiaries of United Healthcare, a large commercial insurance
provider in the United States. All study data were accessed
using techniques compliant with the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. This study was
exempt from institutional review board review because it
was a retrospective analysis of deidentified administrative
health care claims data.
For the primary exposure, women diagnosed with endometriosis were identified by either 1) ≥2 medical claims with
International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes 617.x
or Tenth Revision (ICD-10-CM) diagnosis codes N80.x in
any position (principal or secondary) on an inpatient or
outpatient claim; or 2) 1 endometriosis-related inpatient
or outpatient medical claim with a laparoscopic procedure
code within the previous 30 days (i.e., “laparoscopically
confirmed” endometriosis). These criteria for endometriosis
were used to minimize the potential for coding errors or ruleout diagnoses. The cohort entry date (index) for women with
endometriosis was the date of the second claim or the date
of the endometriosis claim after the laparoscopic procedure,
whichever came first. In general, the distribution of the
baseline characteristics between women defined using ≥2
claims of endometriosis and the laparoscopically confirmed
endometriosis was not appreciably different; therefore, the
primary analysis included women meeting either definition
(Web Table 1) (available at https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/
kwaa249).
For each woman with endometriosis, we sampled up to
2 reference patients of the same age (±1 year) without a
prior diagnosis of endometriosis but who had a claim for
a general medical or annual gynecological examination on
the same cohort entry date as the matched exposed patient,
using a risk-set sampling approach. Variable matching up
to 2 reference patients can yield higher precision than 1:1
matching and retains more exposed subjects than a fixed
ratio. Matching on age controlled for confounding. The

Statistical analysis

Baseline characteristics of women with and without endometriosis were assessed on the start of all available claims
data before and including the date of cohort entry. A difference was calculated between the exposure and reference
value. Confidence intervals around the difference were generated using the Wald method (28) and a 2-sample comparison of means using the t distribution for continuous
variables. Outcomes were assessed in the follow-up period
beginning 1 day after cohort entry to the occurrence of
the event, database disenrollment, death, hysterectomy, or
March 31, 2019, whichever occurred first. Cox proportional
hazards regression was used to generate hazard ratios and
95% confidence intervals for each outcome.
Variables known or hypothesized to be associated with
endometriosis and mental health conditions were selected
as potential confounders (2, 29–32). Factors not associated
with the exposure (i.e., had an absolute difference <5) or

METHODS

reference cohort was drawn from general and gynecologic
examinations because women’s health may be managed by
obstetrician–gynecologists or other health provider types
such as internal or family medicine practitioners. Patients in
the reference group had to meet the same enrollment, inclusion, and exclusion criteria. A requirement for a medical visit
was used to minimize the possibility of detection bias that
arises due to the increase in the number of clinical encounters associated with a new diagnosis of endometriosis, which
then may lead to the discovery of other morbidities, including a mood disorder (20).
Women in both the exposed and unexposed groups were
required to be health plan enrollees at least 183 days before
and on the cohort entry date with a 45-day gap allowed in
continuous enrollment. Patients were not eligible if, on the
cohort entry date, they were younger than < 18 years or older
than 50 years. Women were also excluded if they had a claim
prior to any time from the start of follow-up until the date of
cohort entry for depression, anxiety, self-directed violence,
cancer, or hysterectomy; or a prescription claim for a filled
antidepressant or antianxiety medication.
There were 3 primary outcomes of interest: incident depression, anxiety, and self-directed violence. Depression
and anxiety were defined using ICD-9-CM and ICD-10CM diagnosis codes (Web Table 2) from the medical claim
(21–25). Self-directed violence was defined using ICD-9CM and ICD-10-CM codes for suicide, suicide attempt,
and intentional self-inflicted injury or self-harm from the
medical claim (Web Table 2) (26, 27).
Information on participants’ race/ethnicity (White, nonHispanic; Black, non-Hispanic; Hispanic; Asian, nonHispanic) and region of residence (West, Midwest, South,
and Northeast) were provided in the deidentified database.
The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis and procedure
codes in any position were used to detect the presence
or absence of comorbid conditions on or any time before
the cohort entry date (i.e., the baseline period). National
Drug Code information was used to detect filled medication
prescriptions, which served as a proxy for medication use
during the baseline period (Web Table 2).

Endometriosis and Mental Health Outcomes

Sensitivity analysis

We performed several additional sensitivity analyses.
First, we restricted the exposed population to women with
an endometrioses diagnosis code that occurred within 30
days of a laparoscopic procedure (i.e., surgically confirmed
endometriosis) because this would be the strictest method to
define and confirm the disease. Notably, empiric treatment
regimens often are prescribed before visualization of lesions
(1, 33). Second, models with alternative definitions for
depression and anxiety were used. In these analyses,
depression was defined as 1) an ICD diagnosis code for
depression or a prescription claim for a filled antidepressant
medication, and 2) an ICD diagnosis code for depression and
a prescription claim for a filled antidepressant medication.
Similar criteria were applied to define anxiety using ICD
diagnosis codes for anxiety and/or a prescription claim for a
filled antianxiety medication. Finally, an adjusted model was
generated that excluded uterine fibroids, chronic headaches
or migraine headaches, chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia,
asthma, type 2 diabetes, fatigue, and hypertension, because
these may be downstream consequences of endometriosis.
All analyses were performed using Aetion Evidence
Platform, version 3.7 (New York, New York), which has
been validated (34). All P values were 2 sided.
RESULTS

After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 72,677
women diagnosed with endometriosis were matched to
147,251 women never diagnosed with endometriosis (Web
Figure 1). The median age was 34 years (interquartile
range, 29, 40). The overall median follow-up time was
529 (interquartile range, 195, 1,164) days. Those with
endometriosis were more likely to be White, non-Hispanic,
and from the South. Women with endometriosis were more
likely to have dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, pelvic pain, inferAm J Epidemiol. 2021;190(5):843–852

tility, and use nonopioid analgesics and opioids (Table 1).
Other pain-related comorbidities were more frequently
documented among women with endometriosis, including
chronic headaches or migraine headaches and chronic low
back pain. Immunological and chronic conditions such as
allergies, asthma, fatigue, hypertension, hypothyroidism,
and thyroid disease occurred more frequently in women
with endometriosis (Web Table 3).
Overall, women with endometriosis had a higher rate of
clinically recognized anxiety (57.1 vs. 39.8, respectively, per
1,000 person-years), depression (47.7 vs. 31.5, respectively,
per 1,000 person-years), and self-directed violence (0.9 vs.
0.4, respectively, per 1,000 person-years) than those without endometriosis (Table 2). After multivariable adjustment
(model 1), women with endometriosis were 1.38 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34, 1.42) times as likely to develop
clinically recognized anxiety, 1.48 (95% CI, 1.44, 1.53)
times as likely to have clinically recognized depression, and
2.03 (95% CI, 1.60, 2.58) times as likely to have clinically recognized self-directed violence (Table 2). In models
stratified by age group, the hazard ratios for all outcomes
were stronger in women younger than 35 years than women
≥35 years of age (Table 2), although statistically significant
heterogeneity was only met for depression (P for heterogeneity <0.01 for depression, 0.41 for anxiety, and 0.60 for
self-directed violence). When potential downstream consequences of endometriosis were removed from the model, the
results were not appreciably altered (model 2) (Table 2).
The association between endometriosis and clinically recognized anxiety, depression, and self-directed violence was
consistent across various sensitivity analyses. When depression and anxiety were defined using 1) diagnosis claims or
medication use or 2) diagnosis claims and medication use,
the hazard ratios did not meaningfully change (Web Tables
4–5). Furthermore, results were not appreciably different
when analyses were restricted to women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis (Web Tables 6–7).
In the analysis restricted to women with endometriosis,
characteristics associated with significantly greater rate of
depression, anxiety, and self-directed harm were identified through multivariable models (Table 3). Endometriosisassociated pain (i.e., dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and pelvic
pain) was associated with higher rates of anxiety, depression, and self-directed harm. Other risk factors associated
with incident depression and incident anxiety included painrelated comorbidities, prior use of opioid analgesics, fatigue,
and asthma. Prior use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone
agonists and oral contraceptives was associated with elevated rates of depression, and interstitial cystitis, allergic
rhinitis, and allergies were associated with elevated rates of
anxiety. Factors associated with higher rates of self-directed
harm included prior use of opioids, migraine headaches, and
asthma.
Several factors were associated with significantly lower
rates of depression and anxiety among women with endometriosis. Women who had a prior pregnancy, uterine
fibroids, and hyperlipidemia had lower rates of depression
and anxiety. Vitamin D deficiency was associated with lower
risk of depression; use of oral contraceptives and history of
infertility were associated with lower risk of anxiety.

on the causal pathway between endometriosis and mental
health conditions (e.g., endometriosis-associated pain) were
not included in the models. Estimates were adjusted for
race/ethnicity, region of residence, uterine fibroids, chronic
headaches or migraine headaches, chronic low back pain,
fibromyalgia, asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatigue,
hypertension, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, and
use of opioid analgesics, antihypertensives, and corticosteroids. Additional adjustment for other variables in Table 1
did not further modify the hazard ratio (data not shown).
Except for race/ethnicity (4 categories) and region of
residence (4 categories), all other variables were defined
as ever vs. never. We conducted stratified analyses by age
group (<35 and ≥35 years) and used the Wald test to detect
a potential interaction with endometriosis status.
We restricted the sample to women with endometriosis
to assess the association between baseline factors and the
rate of mood disorders. We developed 3 separate Cox proportional hazards regression models, with anxiety, depression, and self-directed harm as the dependent variable. The
independent variables included in the models were mutually
adjusted.

sensitivity analyses, including alternative definitions of the
exposure, outcomes, and study population. Endometriosisassociated pain and prevalence of other chronic comorbidities were risk factors for incident depression, anxiety,
and self-directed violence among women with endometriosis.

The positive association between endometriosis and mental health conditions is consistent with findings of 2 prior
cohort studies. Within the Taiwan National Health Insurance
Research Database, women with endometriosis had a greater
risk of any depressive disorder (hazard ratio = 1.44, 95% CI,

1.25, 1.65), and anxiety disorder (hazard ratio = 1.44, 95%
CI, 1.22, 1.70) compared with women without endometriosis (35). The strongest associations were among women
younger than 40 years of age, similar to our findings (35). In
a previous study that incorporated Optum claims data, the

depressive symptoms (51). In contrast, co-existing fibroids,
prior pregnancy, and infertility were associated with lower
risk of depression and anxiety. Although women undergoing infertility treatment may have increased anxiety, (52)
the impact of infertility on depression and anxiety may be
modified by treatment success (53–55).
There are several clinical implications for the knowledge
gained in this study. First, consistent and active screening
for mood disorders in this population of women would
assist with diagnosis and also address potential underlying
psychological disease processes that affect quality of life.
Second, incorporating the conversation regarding psychological well-being into daily care for those with endometriosis provides a platform from which to influence the chronic
pain cycle and worsening of psychological disease that
often occurs due to pain perception (56). Third, treatment
options can be offered for both emotion regulation difficulties and physical symptoms, including offering coping
strategies from behavioral, cognitive, and emotional standpoints that may improve ultimate adherence to the continued
management of these long-term medical conditions (57, 58).
The significant presence of anxiety, depression, and selfdirected harm in women with endometriosis as compared
with women never diagnosed with endometriosis modifies
our practice to identify and continue to destigmatize mental
health issues in a population that is otherwise often considered healthy.
Strengths of this study include the use of a database with
a large, contemporary cohort of commercially insured individuals with broad geographic coverage, the ability to adjust
for many potential confounders, and the implementation of
multiple sensitivity analyses that increase the confidence in
the observed results. Furthermore, because of the prospective nature of this study, the temporal sequence between
the endometriosis diagnosis and the mood disorders is more
clearly indicated because women who had a received a mental health diagnosis before the first diagnosis of endometriosis were excluded. This is critical for establishing potential
cause-and-effect directionality and for diminishing the risk
of diagnostic bias.
Several limitations also should be noted, however. First,
endometriosis and mood disorders are chronic conditions;
therefore, we were unable to assess the timing of the onset
of endometriosis or mental health conditions. Rather, we
were able to assess the temporal relationship of receiving
a clinically recognized diagnosis of mood disorders among
women with previously clinically recognized endometriosis.
This was further complicated by delays in diagnosis and
limited observed follow-up time in this administrative
database. Additional research on the long-term risk of
mental health conditions in women with endometriosis
and on the impact of diagnostic delays on mental health
in databases with longer follow-up is needed. Second, we
used data representing commercially insured, continuously
enrolled adult women, so findings may not be generalizable
to uninsured populations or young women. More effort
is needed to examine the risk of mental health outcomes
in women of different ethnic and cultural background
and younger women with endometriosis (59). Furthermore, women with mild symptoms or who respond well to

association between endometriosis and depression and/or
anxiety was somewhat weaker (hazard ratio = 1.2, 95%
CI, 1.2, 1.3) than the association we found in the present
study, although misclassification of endometriosis and mental health outcomes in this earlier study may have driven
results toward the null (36).
Data on the association between endometriosis and selfdirected violence are limited. Common chronic conditions,
such as diabetes, epilepsy, and asthma, have been associated with a greater risk of both self-harm and suicide (37).
Researchers conducting a population-based cohort study in
Finland found that the mortality rate due to suicide and
sequelae of intentional self-harm was not different in women
with surgically verified endometriosis compared to those
without endometriosis (38). In contrast, our findings suggest
that rates of self-directed violence, which included nonfatal
and fatal events, were nearly 2–3 times higher for women
with endometriosis in the United States. It is also possible that the difference in the observed association is due
to different patient characteristics and factors related to
women’s lifestyle and/or increased medical attention and
care received.
Among women with endometriosis, we identified several potential risk factors for mental health conditions.
Endometriosis-associated pain symptoms and other painrelated comorbidities were associated with greater risk of
mental health conditions, Consistent with prior studies,
our findings suggest that chronic endometriosis-associated
pain (39, 40) and chronic pain comorbidities (16–18) may
be a significant factor for the development of depression
and anxiety among women with endometriosis. In a recent
meta-analysis on endometriosis and depressive symptoms,
women with endometriosis were found to be more likely
to have depressive symptoms relative to women without
endometriosis and, among women with endometriosis,
those with pelvic pain reported higher levels of depression
compared with those without pain. Depressive symptoms
were not different between patients with endometriosis and
pelvic pain compared with women with pelvic pain due to
other conditions (19) The results of the present study expand
on the findings on endometriosis and depressive symptoms
by examining incident diagnosis of depression, as well as
anxiety and self-directed harm.
Endometriosis may affect the development of depression
and anxiety through several pathways. Chronic pain can
lead to social isolation and can negatively affect emotional
well-being (41, 42). Chronic pain may be related to depression through common neuroplasticity mechanism changes,
including effects on monoamine neurotransmitters, brainderived neurotrophic factor, and glutamate and its receptor
subtypes (14). From animal studies, researchers found that
endometriosis alters brain gene expression and electrophysiology that lead to an increase in pain sensitization, anxiety,
and depression (43). Finally, the chronic inflammation of
endometriosis may impair the brain–blood barrier and disturb certain areas of the brain, leading to mood or behavioral
disturbances (14, 15, 44–49). Studies have shown treatment
with proinflammatory agents, such as interferon-α, were
associated with more symptoms of depression, (50) whereas
the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decreased

treatment may have only 1 medical claim for endometriosis
and would not meet the study definition for endometriosis;
thus, results may not be generalizable to all women with
endometriosis.
Other known limitations common to administrative claims
data include lack of clinical documentation, misdiagnosis,
and miscoding (60). For instance, misclassification of
endometriosis is possible in claims data because a diagnosis code may not be used in women with suspected
endometriosis or nonsurgically diagnosed endometriosis.
Therefore, a proportion of our matched unexposed group
included patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic but
undiagnosed endometriosis, biasing the association toward
the null. However, we expect this misclassification to
be minimal because the likely community prevalence of
severe or symptomatic endometriosis is <2% (61), and the
characteristics of this small proportion of undiagnosed,
exposed women will be diluted among the hundreds of
true endometriosis-free unexposed women. In addition,
the presence of a diagnosis code for endometriosis may
have identified women whose symptoms progressed to have
greater impact on quality of life, whose treatment included
more advanced interventions, or whose disease advanced
to a higher, revised American Society for Reproductive
Medicine disease stage. Notably, data to quantify the revised
American Society for Reproductive Medicine stage of disease were unavailable in these data because, unfortunately,
they are not routinely or uniformly documented in claims
or electronic medical records (62, 63). However, because
the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine
disease stage is poorly correlated with severity of symptoms,
their life impact, or response to treatment, it is unlikely to be
an important confounder (64). In addition, <50% of women
with endometriosis in this study had dysmenorrhea, a
common symptom of endometriosis, so pain symptoms may
not have been fully captured by ICD codes, because there
is no standardization for documentation (65). Compared
to administrative data for reimbursement, electronic health
record databases capture a far richer source of clinical
data and health behavior information, potentially providing
useful insights into the clinical characteristics, symptom
duration, and psychiatric symptoms of endometriosis
patients (66).
Finally, as with other studies conducted using administrative claims data, filled prescriptions were used as a proxy
for medication use. Although there is uncertainty whether a
dispensed prescription is consumed by the patient, pharmacy
dispensing claims data reliably predict medication exposure
to prescription medications, especially for chronically used
medications (67, 68).
Women diagnosed with endometriosis are at higher risk
for clinically recognized depression, anxiety, and selfdirected violence relative to women without endometriosis.
Furthermore, among women with endometriosis, pain is
an important risk factor for subsequent mood disorders.
A multidisciplinary approach that identifies women with
endometriosis who are at risk for development of depression
and anxiety may improve patient-centered management and
affect treatment strategies for preventing and managing
mood disorders.
