ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

Endometriosis, a chronic gynecological disease affecting approximately 10% of women of repro­
ductive age, has a significant impact on physical and mental health. This cross-sectional study
aimed to explore experiences of validating and invalidating communication in three contexts
(with healthcare providers, employers, and family/friends), and whether this may predict healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL) in women with endometriosis. Data was collected through a
digital survey distributed to women with self-reported endometriosis in Sweden. The survey
included measures of validating and invalidating communication, depressive symptoms, anxiety,
and HRQoL. A total of 427 women participated. The results indicated that women experienced
varying levels of validating and invalidating communication in different contexts, with close fam­
ily/friends providing the highest level of validation, and healthcare providers the lowest.
Furthermore, a combined construct of high levels of validation and low levels of invalidation
from healthcare providers and from close family and friends were significant predictors of
HRQoL. These findings highlight the importance of supportive communication and understand­
ing from healthcare providers and close social networks in promoting the well-being of women
with endometriosis. Future research should further explore the impact of validating communica­
tion within healthcare settings and develop interventions to improve communication and sup­
port for women with endometriosis.

Introduction
Endometriosis, affecting about 10% of women of
reproductive age, is a chronic gynaecological disease
that is inflammatory in nature. The most common
symptoms include pain during menstruation and ovu­
lation, as well as during intercourse, urination or defe­
cation, low back pain, chronic pelvic pain [1] and
infertility [2]. Affected women’s health-related quality
of life (HRQoL) is often negatively impacted [3], with
associations between the disease and reduced emo­
tional, physical, psychological, social, and sexual
health [4,5].
To diagnose endometriosis, the "gold standard"
involves undergoing laparoscopy to confirm the pres­
ence of endometrial tissue through histological ana­
lysis [1]. However, it often takes many years for

women to receive a proper diagnosis and appropriate
treatment [6,7]. Along the way to a diagnosis, women
frequently interact with many healthcare professionals
and describe their experiences as problematic, includ­
ing symptom normalization and trivialization [8,9].
Encountering disbelief and trivialization during med­
ical appointments and examinations increases the risk
of feeling exposed, both mentally and physically [9].
Some women with endometriosis avoid seeking med­
ical care or discussing their suffering [10], leading to
damaged self-esteem and feelings of worthlessness or
anger [11]. Conversely, positive encounters with
healthcare professionals may have a beneficial impact
on affected women’s self-esteem, as they feel vali­
dated and understood [9]. Therefore, the attitude and
communication of healthcare professionals have a

significant impact on women with endometriosis [8,9],
although sparse research has focused on women’s
experiences of specific communication behavior in
healthcare settings.
Endometriosis often affects women’s work perform­
ance, through increased levels of sick leave, medica­
tion that affects their work efficiency, and limited
possibilities for professional development [7,12]. Many
women feel uncomfortable disclosing their diagnosis
or symptoms to colleagues or employers, fearing a
bad reputation, discrimination, or disbelief [12]. In
addition, disclosing symptoms to those in higher posi­
tions can be embarrassing, leading to hesitancy in
sharing [13]. However, more research on experienced
communication in workplace settings is needed.
Women’s close relationships have also been associ­
ated with these sentiments. Mat�ıas-Gonz�alez et al. dis­
covered that women with endometriosis experienced
stigmatization from friends, partners, and family mem­
bers [10]. Additionally, Hudson et al. revealed that the
diagnosis of endometriosis had adverse effects on sex­
ual intimacy, relationships, and family planning [14].
Psychosocial support is crucial for enhancing the wellbeing and quality of life of women with endometriosis
[15], and fostering emotional intimacy between part­
ners can serve as a protective factor for relationship
satisfaction [16]. Consequently, supportive communica­
tion, understanding, and encouragement from individ­
uals in their social network, including healthcare
professionals, employers, and close family and friends,
play a pivotal role in promoting the well-being of
women with endometriosis.
In other pain conditions, validating (supportive)
communication has emerged as a key component for
the pain sufferer to feel understood, facilitating adap­
tation to pain and its emotional consequences [17].
Validation is generally described as communicating
acceptance and understanding, while its opposite,
invalidation refers to trivializing or dismissing the
experience [18,19]. Validation has been related to
increased emotional well-being and physical function­
ing in several contexts such as in healthcare settings
and with romantic partners [17], while invalidation has
been associated with increased pain and suffering
[18]. Recent findings support similar links in other
chronic illnesses, indicating that validation may build
resilience and HRQoL [20].
Yet, experiences of (in)validation have not been
studied in women with endometriosis. In particular,
research on perceived communication in social and
professional contexts is missing. The aim of this study
was to explore experiences of (in)validation in three

key contexts (with healthcare providers, employers,
and family/friends), and whether this may predict
HRQoL in women with endometriosis.

Material and methods
In this cross-sectional study, data was collected during
one month, fall 2022, through a digital survey nation­
ally distributed through posters and social media, to
reach women with self-reported endometriosis in
Sweden. Eligible participants were directed to a web­
page where they were informed about the study and
consented to participate by ticking a box before enter­
ing the digital survey in a closed system for data col­
lection provided by the university. The study was
approved by the Swedish Ethical Review Authority
(Dnr 2022-05874-01).

Participants
The inclusion criteria were [1] female (biological sex)
[2], 18 years old or older [3] having received an endo­
metriosis diagnosis. Among the initial 432 participants,
five women were excluded due to a large proportion
of missing data. In the remaining sample (N ¼ 427),
the mean age was 34 years (SD ¼ 8.45; range 18–72),
79% were in a relationship, and 43% had children.
More than half of the sample (54%) reported univer­
sity as their highest completed education. 21% were
on sick leave. Years with symptoms ranged between 1
and 58 years.

Measures
Participants were asked to keep their symptoms of
endometriosis in mind when responding to the ques­
tionnaires, except for when rating depressive symp­
toms and anxiety. Swedish versions of all scales were
used.

Demographics
Demographic information covered age, symptom dur­
ation, relationship status, children, educational level,
and sick leave.
Symptoms of endometriosis
The Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30) [21] was
used to assess endometriosis health status during the
last four weeks on five subscales: pain, control and
powerlessness, social support, emotional well-being
and self-image. This scale entails 30 items where the
respondent rates how often situations and symptoms

JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOMATIC OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

occur, from “Never” to “Always” on a Likert- scale
ranging from 1–5, with a total of 100 on each sub­
scale. The total score was then computed by adding
the subscales and dividing by five, resulting in a total
score between 0 and 100, where 100 indicates the
lowest possible endometriosis health status. The
Swedish version of this scale has shown good psycho­
metric properties [22], and in the current study, the
internal consistency was excellent (a¼.96).

Validation and invalidation
The Validation and Invalidation Response Scale (VIRS)
[23] was used to explore experienced validating and
invalidating communication in three different contexts.
To this aim, the word “partner” in the original VIRS
was changed to “healthcare providers”, “close family
and friends” and “employers”. VIRS has been used in
similar contexts in earlier research [24–26]. In line with
these studies, we decreased the number of items from
16 (original VIRS) to 14. One item was left out because
of its ambiguity of double negotiation, and another
was left out because it’s only applicable in more intim­
ate relationships. It was then more comparable to
have the same content in all three versions of VIRS.
The participant rated the frequency of different situa­
tions from “Never” (0) to “Almost all of the time” [4]
on two subscales: validation (9 items) and invalidation
(5 items). Internal consistency was excellent in all
three contexts (healthcare providers a¼.97; employers
a¼.96; close family and friends a¼.96).
Depressive symptoms
Perceived Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) [27] was
used to assess depressive symptoms during the last
two weeks. This scale consists of nine items, which the
respondent rates the frequency of on a 4-point Likert
scale ranging from “Not at all” (0) to “Nearly every
day” [4]. The total score ranges from 0 to 27, where
high scores indicate a higher level of symptoms. The
PHQ-9 has shown acceptable properties for identifying
major depressive disorder at cutoff scores between 8
and 11 [28]. The Swedish version of PHQ-9 has shown
good reliability and validity [29] and in the current
study, the internal consistency was good (a¼.89).
Anxiety
Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7 (GAD-7) [30] was used
to assess symptoms of anxiety during the last two
weeks. It consists of seven items, which are answered
on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from “Not at all” (0)
to “Nearly every day” [3]. The total score is 21, with
high scores indicating higher levels of anxiety. The

3

GAD-7 had shown acceptable properties for detecting
GAD at cutoff scores 7–10 [31]. The original scale has
shown good reliability and validity [30], and in the
current study, internal consistency was good (a¼.89).

Statistical analysis
IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) ver­
sion 28.0 was used for the analyses. Normality was
inspected through skewness and kurtosis statistics in
combination with visual inspection of Q-Q plots and
Shapiro-Wilk tests. All study variables were normally
distributed in all but the Shapiro-Wilk test. A non-para­
metric alternative was used to confirm the parametric
Pearson product-moment correlation. As the results
did not differ considerably in the Spearman’s rank
coefficient of correlation, the results from the paramet­
ric tests are reported. Associations between study vari­
ables were investigated through Pearson’s productmoment correlations. To test whether experienced
validation and invalidation differed between contexts,
two separate one-way repeated measures ANOVA
were executed, with the addition of pairwise compari­
sons based on estimated marginal means with
Bonferroni adjustments for multiple comparisons [32].
The predictive value of depressive symptoms, anx­
iety and (in)validating communication on HRQoL was
tested through hierarchical multiple regression analysis
with two steps. In the first step, depressive symptoms
and anxiety were entered. In the second step per­
ceived validation from healthcare providers, employers
and close family and friends was entered.

Results
Validating and invalidating communication in
three different contexts
The group comparison of validating communication
within the three contexts (healthcare providers,
employers and close family and friends) showed statis­
tically significant group differences (F(2, 812) ¼ 105.7,
p < .001, partial g2 ¼ .21). Pairwise comparisons
revealed that the level of validating communication in
all three contexts differed significantly from each
other, see Table 1.
Likewise, the group comparison of invalidating
communication within the three contexts (healthcare
providers, employers and close family and friends)
showed statistically significant group differences (F(2,
806) ¼ 72.41, p < .001, partial g2 ¼ .15). Pairwise com­
parisons revealed that the level of invalidating

389)¼164.99, p < .001), explaining 46% of the vari­
ance in endometriosis HRQoL. In the next step, (in)va­
lidating communication in three different contexts was
added to the model, resulting in a significant total
model (F(5, 386)¼76.50, p < .001). All variables, except
(in)validating communication from employers, contrib­
uted with unique variance in the model. In other
words, higher levels of experienced (in)validating com­
munication from healthcare providers and close family
and friends, both significantly predicted higher levels
of endometriosis HRQoL. Further, higher levels of
symptoms of depression and anxiety predicted lower
levels of endometriosis HRQoL.
All variables except (in)validating communication
from employers contributed with unique variance in
the regression model. To put it differently, experi­
enced (in)validating communication from healthcare
providers and close family and friends, both signifi­
cantly predicted endometriosis HRQoL, over and
above symptoms of depression and anxiety. In com­
parison to the other factors, symptoms of depression
contributed to the largest part of the variance in the
model.

Validating and invalidating communication in
three different contexts in relation to quality of
life, depressive symptoms and anxiety
Due to high intercorrelations (d¼–0.85, −0.73 and
−0.84, p < .001) between validating and invalidating
communication in the three contexts, these variables
were combined into a composite measure of (in)vali­
dation. The composite measure entails a range where
higher scores indicate more validation and less invali­
dation, whereas lower scores indicate low levels of val­
idation and high levels of invalidation. The correlation
analyses revealed moderate to strong correlations
between (in)validation and quality of life, depressive
symptoms and anxiety, as shown in Table 3.
When exploring the predictive value of depressive
symptoms, anxiety and (in)validation on HRQoL in a
hierarchical multiple regression, symptoms of depres­
sion and anxiety were entered in the first step. As
seen in Table 4, the model was significant (F(2,

The purpose of this study was to explore experienced
(in)validation in three contexts among women with
endometriosis, and its potential impact on HRQoL. The
results showed that the degree of experienced (in)vali­
dation differed significantly between contexts. The
findings from healthcare settings stood out, as com­
pared to the other settings, with relatively low levels
of validation and high levels of invalidation. This aligns
with previous research, where women with endometri­
osis have reported instances of being dismissed and
having their treatment neglected by healthcare pro­
viders [9–11]. In fact, relational support has been
pointed out as the most important aspect of care [33],

treatment, care and follow-up, as an independent pre­
dictor of high patient-centeredness among women [33].
The participants indicated that employers were per­
ceived as more validating than healthcare providers,
yet not as validating as close family and friends. This
observation can be understood in the context of ear­
lier research, wherein women have expressed chal­
lenges in discussing endometriosis-related concerns
with colleagues and employers, possibly due to the
stigma they have encountered [13,14].
The highest levels of experienced validation were
obtained in the context of close family and friends.
This aligns with research by Van Niekerk et al. [16],
who emphasized that heightened emotional closeness
can foster a sense of comprehension and support, or
in essence, validation. Yet, other studies have
reported that women with endometriosis experience
negative reactions from family and friends [10]. The
findings from our study indicate a more nuanced pic­
ture, highlighting family and friends as relatively sup­
portive contexts in comparison to healthcare and
work settings.
As anticipated, depressive symptoms and anxiety
were strongly associated with reduced HRQoL, explain­
ing almost fifty per cent of the variance. Still, even
after controlling for both depressive symptoms and
anxiety, (in)validation from healthcare providers and
from close family and friends were significant predic­
tors of HRQoL. This indicates that (in)validation indeed
plays an important role for HRQoL in women with
endometriosis, beyond the impact of depression and
anxiety. These outcomes align with findings from
other pain-related populations [17], where validation
has been established as pivotal for positive outcomes.
One limitation of the present study is its cross-sec­
tional design, which precludes the ability to establish
causality. Furthermore, the dataset relied on retrospect­
ive self-reports, having a risk of memory biases. The

Swedish versions of VIRS and GAD-7 are well-estab­
lished and have been commonly used in research and
clinical practice, but they are not formally validated,
which is another limitation. It is also important to note
that the measure of (in)validation was initially devel­
oped for intimate partner relations and has not been
validated in healthcare and work contexts. Yet, this
study was a first step to exploring the role of (in)valida­
tion in different settings for women with endometriosis.
The findings suggest a connection between the
encounter of (in)validation and health-related quality of
life, independent of depressive symptoms and anxiety.
Notably, within healthcare environments, there appears
to be potential for enhancement. A potential subse­
quent stride could involve formulating strategies to
educate healthcare professionals treating women with
endometriosis on effective communication methods
that promote validation.
