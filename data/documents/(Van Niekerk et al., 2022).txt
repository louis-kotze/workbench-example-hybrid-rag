STUDY QUESTION: What is the relationship between self-compassion, endometriosis-related symptoms and psychological health in
women with symptomatic endometriosis?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Decreased self-compassion is associated with increased psychological distress, extended diagnostic delay and
varies according to individual endometriosis-symptom proﬁle.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Existing research indicates that endometriosis is associated with reduced psychological health and varied endometriosis-related symptom proﬁles. Examining the level of self-compassion reported by women with endometriosis is important
as greater self-compassion has been found to improve psychological well-being in several chronic health populations.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This study utilized a cross-sectional survey design to explore the relationship between self-

compassion, psychological health and endometriosis-related symptoms (n ¼ 318).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women with a self-reported diagnosis of endometriosis were recruited via
online advertising through social media platforms. Demographic and endometriosis-speciﬁc information (e.g. disease stage, diagnostic delay,
symptom experience) was collected in addition to psychological health and self-compassion. Psychological health was measured by the
PROMIS Emotional Distress and Anxiety short forms and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15). Self-compassion was measured by
the Self-Compassion Scale (26-item). Independent t-tests, bivariate correlations and linear regression analyses explored the relationship between speciﬁc endometriosis-related symptoms, psychological health and self-compassion.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Hierarchical multiple regression indicated that psychological symptoms accounted
for the greatest variance in levels of self-compassion in the current sample. Depression and anxiety were found to be signiﬁcant negative
predictors of self-compassion. Notable symptoms that were signiﬁcant in the ﬁnal model were the presence of dysmenorrhea, lower back
pain, dyspareunia, pain after sexual intercourse, fatigue and nausea.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The cross-sectional nature of the ﬁndings prevents direct ﬁndings of causality. The infor-

mation pertaining to endometriosis was self-report in nature and was not medically veriﬁed.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These preliminary ﬁndings indicate the importance of clinical interventions aimed at en-

hancing self-compassion and the importance of individual case conceptualization and treatment planning based on endometriosis-related
symptomatic proﬁles.
STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(s): The study was not associated with research funding. Author L.V.N. is a member of

the Endometriosis Australia Clinical Advisory Committee.

Self-compassion in women with endometriosis

judgmental about my own flaws and inadequacies’). Common humanity encompasses a recognition that vulnerability and suffering are part
of the human experience (e.g. ‘When I’m down, I remind myself that
there are lots of other people in the world feeling like I am’) compared to a sense of isolation (e.g. ‘When I’m feeling down, I tend to
feel like most other people are probably happier than I am’).
Mindfulness involves a willingness to observe and experience negative
thoughts or emotions (e.g. ‘When something upsets me I try to keep
my emotions in balance’) compared to a belief that negative thoughts
or feelings need to be supressed or over-identified with (e.g. ‘When
I’m feeling down I tend to obsess and fixate on everything that’s
wrong’; Neff, 2003a,b).
Given that endometriosis is associated with an increased level of
psychological distress and reduced quality of life (Sullivan-Myers et al.,
2021), and that self-compassion has been proposed as a protective
factor in chronic health issues (Sirois and Rowse, 2016), it may provide
a potential treatment pathway for women with endometriosis. Terry
and Leary (2011) theorized that self-compassion may function by enhancing emotion regulation, thereby facilitating a kinder and less reactive stance toward the self when facing the difficulties of illness.
Lending support to this theory, researchers explored the role of selfcompassion across a sample of individuals with cancer, various chronic
illnesses and a healthy control group. They revealed that of those in
the cancer and chronic illness groups, scoring lower on selfcompassion was associated with greater depression, stress and reduced quality of life when compared to the control group (PintoGouveia et al., 2014).
There is also evidence to suggest that self-compassion may influence
health outcomes through physiological pathways. One such study investigated inflammatory stress response and interleukin-6 (IL-6), a proinflammatory protein which has been implicated in the development of
endometriosis (Breines et al., 2014; Li et al., 2017). Breines et al.
(2014) revealed that participants with higher self-compassion displayed
lower levels of IL-6, even when self-esteem, depressive symptoms, demographic factors and distress were partialled out. This suggests that
self-compassion could be a protective factor against inflammatory conditions such as endometriosis.
Research examining the relationship between self-compassion and
persistent pain has found that greater self-compassion is associated
with greater pain adjustment, particularly in relation to affect, painrelated catastrophizing and disability (Wren et al., 2012) and higher
levels of pain acceptance (Costa and Pinto-Gouveia, 2011). Barnes
et al. (2021) explored the role of self-compassion in the affectiveemotional dimension of persistent pain and found that self-compassion
may foster pain acceptance through engagement of a kind and understanding approach to self. These studies highlight the potential benefit
of self-compassion in women experiencing persistent health diagnoses,
such as endometriosis, where pain is a significant symptom.
The research highlighted above indicates the important role that
self-compassion may play in managing the emotional, physical and
pain-related consequences of endometriosis yet the research exploring
the level of self-compassion in women diagnosed with endometriosis is
lacking as is an understanding of how symptom variability, both in
terms of presence and severity, impacts on level of self-compassion.
Given the promising findings regarding the protective effects of selfcompassion on psychological well-being and adjustment in other forms
of persistent health conditions, and the recent developments in

and for the current level of endometriosis-related pain.

Psychological health
The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information
System—Emotional Distress Short Forms (PROMIS) for depression
and anxiety are well-validated, reliable brief measures of psychological distress with excellent internal consistency (Pilkonis et al., 2011).
The PROMIS Depression Short Form (PROMIS Emotional Distress
(PED)) is an 8-item measure assessing the cognitive and affective
expressions of depression (e.g. ‘I felt helpless’). The PROMIS
Anxiety Short Form (PAS) is 7-item scale measuring anxiety symptoms, encompassing fears, worries and somatic symptoms (e.g. ‘I felt
tense’). Both scales use a 7-day time frame and a 5-point severity
scale, where 1 ¼ ‘never’ and 5 ¼ ‘always’. Cronbach’s alpha for the
current sample for the PED was a ¼ 0.950 and a ¼ 0.930 for the PAS.

Somatic symptom severity
The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-15; Kroenke et al., 2002)
measures the distress related to 15 somatic symptoms (e.g. headaches, dizziness, back pain) that an individual may have experienced
over a 4-week period. Somatic symptom distress is rated on a 3-point
scale (0 ¼ ‘not bothered at all’, 1 ¼ ‘bothered a little’, 2 ¼ ‘bothered a
lot’), with PHQ-15 scores of 5, 10 and 15 representing severity cutoff
points. The PHQ-15 demonstrates good internal reliability and validity
(Kroenke et al., 2002). Cronbach’s alpha for the current sample was
a ¼ 0.780.

Self-compassion
The Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) is a validated and reliable measure of
self-compassion with excellent internal consistency (Neff, 2003a). The
26-item questionnaire measures self-compassionate attitudes across
the three main elements of self-compassion and their associated counterparts: self-kindness (self-judgment), common humanity (isolation)
and mindfulness (over-identification; Neff, 2003a). Participants rate
each item on a 5-point scale, where 1 ¼ ‘almost never’ and
5 ¼ ‘almost always’. The inventory is designed to provide an overall
measure of an individual’s level of self-compassion and scores are
reported as a total mean score. Although clinical cut-off scores are not
available, self-compassion may be categorized as low (score range:
1.0–2.49), moderate (score range: 2.5–3.5) or high (score range:
3.51–5.0; Neff et al., 2017). Cronbach’s alpha for the current sample
was a ¼ 0.784.

Design and data analysis
A cross-sectional correlational design was employed to investigate the
presence, degree and direction of relationships between participant
characteristics, endometriosis symptoms, psychological health and selfcompassion. Statistical means (M), standard deviations and score range
are reported for outcome measures. A GPower priori power analysis
indicated that a total of 210 participants were required (P ¼ <0.05),
with moderate effect sizes, to achieve a power of 0.95 in t-tests, 196
participants in f-tests and 208 participants for linear regression (Faul
et al., 2007; Mayr et al., 2007). Statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 24. Characteristics of study participants were analyzed using
one-way between groups ANOVA and independent t-tests were used
to determine the effect of individual symptom presence on outcome

Therefore, the present study aims to examine endometriosis-related
symptom experience and self-compassion among a sample of women
with endometriosis. The study also aims to explore whether certain
participant characteristics or endometriosis-related symptoms can predict variability in levels of self-compassion. Based on these findings, the
study aims to identify a possible symptom profile which may help to
inform compassion-focused clinical intervention and treatment
planning.

significantly negatively associated with self-compassion when assessing
their associated level of distress, perhaps suggesting that these symptoms are particularly sensitive to the buffering effects of selfcompassion or vice versa. While there is little to draw upon in the
existing literature, researchers have similarly found reduced levels of
self-compassion in relation to female sexual pain (Vasconcelos et al.,
2020). Moreover, pain associated with urinating or following sexual intercourse was revealed to significantly predict lower self-compassion in
the sample. A reduction in self-compassion with the presence of dyspareunia and pain after sexual intercourse is not surprising given that
sexual impairment has been found to be a significant negative factor in
overall quality of life for women with endometriosis (Della Corte
et al., 2020).
The presence of menorrhagia, diarrhea, bloating and nausea were
found to be positive predictors in the final self-compassion model, suggesting perhaps that these symptoms present less difficulty in cultivating a self-compassionate stance. As menstrual and gut-based
symptoms are characteristic of endometriosis, it is possible that
women perceive symptoms within these areas as more acceptable or
common and therefore easier relate to with a sense of compassion.
Surprisingly, the presence of vulva pain was found to positively predict
self-compassion. Perhaps as suggested above in relation to more frequently endorsed endometriosis-related symptoms, lesser reported
symptoms such as vulva pain may also be approached with a greater
sense of compassion and kindness. Santerre-Baillargeon et al., (2018)
suggest that facilitating self-compassion in women with vulvodynia, a
chronic vulvovaginal pain condition, is important due to the impact of
vulva pain on women’s sexual self-image and increased feelings of isolation and inadequacy. They posit that cultivating a higher sense of selfkindness could facilitate lower psychological and sexual distress for
women. To further elucidate these relationships in women with endometriosis, future research might consider exploring the meaning
women attribute to the presence and experience of individual
endometriosis-related symptoms (O’Neill and Morrow, 2001), and
whether individual components of self-compassion (e.g. self-kindness)
are particularly influential in coping with vulva pain. The inclusion of
qualitative research may also allow a greater understanding of the
presence of self-compassionate language and the role that this plays in
mitigating symptom burden.

Self-compassion in women with endometriosis

engaged with online accounts. This was mitigated by widely distributing
the recruitment advertisement through multiple national and international social media sites, platforms, support groups and forums. The
use of an anonymous online survey presentation also minimizes the
likelihood of response bias as participants can answer in an honest and
forthright manner, particularly in relation to sensitive health-related information. A final limitation is that the endometriosis-related data was
self-report in nature and was not verified through examination of medical records. Notwithstanding these limitations, the current study has
contributed novel findings to the literature and adds to the recommendation for further understanding of the psychosocial impact of endometriosis and how these may be addressed (Dunselman et al., 2014).
The research pertaining to self-compassion and endometriosis is lacking. Moreover, the current study has captured a large sample of
women with endometriosis, from four international regions, and in all
stages of the condition, suggesting there is fair generalizability of
results, with similar participant demographics (e.g. education level, age,
employment status) and psychological health reported in previous
cross-sectional studies (e.g. Sullivan-Myers et al., 2021).
