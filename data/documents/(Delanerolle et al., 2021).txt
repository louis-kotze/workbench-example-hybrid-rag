Abstract
Background: It is important to evaluate sequalae for complex chronic health conditions such as endometriosis and
mental health disorders. Endometriosis impacts 1 in 10 women. Mental health outcomes can be a primary determinant in
many physical health conditions although this is an area not well researched particularly in women’s health. This has been
problematic for endometriosis patients in particular, who report mental health issues as well as other key comorbidities
such as chronic pelvic pain and infertility. This could be partly due to the complexities associated with comprehensively
exploring overlaps between physical and mental health disorders in the presence of multiple comorbidities and their
potential mechanistic relationship.
Methods: In this evidence synthesis, a systematic methodology and mixed-methods approaches were used to synthesize
both qualitative and quantitative data to examine the prevalence of the overlapping sequalae between endometriosis
and psychiatric symptoms and disorders. As part of this, an evidence synthesis protocol was developed which included a
systematic review protocol that was published on PROSPERO (CRD42020181495). The aim was to identify and evaluate
mental health reported outcomes and prevalence of symptoms and psychiatric disorders associated with endometriosis.
Findings: A total of 34 papers were included in the systematic review and 15 were included in the meta-analysis.
Anxiety and depression symptoms were the most commonly reported mental health outcomes while a pooled analysis
also revealed high prevalence of chronic pelvic pain and dyspareunia.
Interpretation: It is evident that small-scale cross-sectional studies have been conducted in a variety of settings to
determine mental health outcomes among endometriosis patients. Further research is required to comprehensively
evaluate the mental health sequalae with endometriosis.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Research into exploring the mental health sequalae in endometriosis is limited. Therefore, to our knowledge, this is
the first evidence synthesis conducted to determine the prevalence of the endometriosis, mental health (MH) and
associated presentations, including chronic pelvic pain. The evidence demonstrated limited data around MH outcomes. Most published systematic reviews and meta-analysis, as well as research studies in relation to endometriosis,
report MH outcomes either in isolation or as a generic quality of life feature, but did not focus on the sequalae.
Previous studies did not estimate the proportion of cases that may be affected or their relevance to Black, Asian and
Minority Ethnic populations.

Added value of this study
This study is composed of a comprehensive evidence synthesis which includes a narrative and meta-analysis conducted using a systematic approach to report the prevalence of the endometriosis and MH sequalae.

Implications of the available evidence
This review demonstrates a complex relationship between MH and endometriosis. To evaluate this disease sequalae
comprehensive research is required. Additionally, race and ethnicity specific information is required to better evaluate
cultural adaptations that may be required for example to improve patient reported outcomes as this study detected the
paucity of this data. This evidence should support the development of new healthcare policies to diagnose and manage
patients more holistically.

Introduction
Endometriosis is defined by the presence of endometrium-like tissue outside the uterine cavity and can lead
to complex outcomes such as dysmenorrhea, chronic
pelvic pain (CPP), sexual dysfunction and subfertility.
Women with endometriosis suffer from a range of symptoms although the most complex of these are frequently
associated with mental health (MH)-related distress and
psychiatric comorbidities. Consequential psychosocial
factors and a range of pelvic pain disorders frequently
exacerbate the patient’s experience of endometriosis and
associated MH symptoms. Cross-sectional studies have
shown exacerbated MH distress due to alterations of
body image, loss, hopelessness, alexithymia and worthlessness as a result of endometriosis.1 Aerts et al.1 summarized the detrimental psychological impact and
adjustments made by women with endometriosis, including heightened pain–related experiences and levels of
distress.
One of the theories of the pathogenesis in endometriosis is Sampson’s transplantation theory,2,3 where retrograde

motion of endometrial cells via the fallopian tubes into the
pelvic cavity during menstruation. During this process,
endometrial tissue implants on the peritoneal surface.
This theory is further evidenced where increases in endometriosis incidence among women with Mullerian Duct
anomalies indicate an obstructed flow increases the possibility of retrograde menstruation. This is also supported
by the frequent, lengthy and heavy menstruation common
in endometriosis, which further increases the exposure of
the pelvic cavity to develop endometriosis. However, contradictions to this theory have been published, as some
epidemiological data indicate that only 0.5%–5% of
women with retrograde menstruation appear to develop
endometriosis.4
The diagnosis and management of endometriosis is
complicated by multiple factors, including issues around
the pathophysiology of the disease, staging, severity and
treatment responses, as well as limitations in current clinical and surgical management. However, the most severe
and common comorbidities are pelvic pain, infertility and
MH issues. As a result of this, further complications may
arise in its long-term management as a result of MH

Delanerolle et al.
symptomatologies and psychiatric comorbidities that may
compromise the social relationships of these patients. CPP
is a key clinical feature of endometriosis which may exacerbate depression and anxiety, and these, in turn, may
exacerbate CPP. In addition to these complex symptoms,
these patients are also at high risk of comorbidities such as
inflammatory bowel disease, adenomyosis, fibromyalgia
and autoimmune diseases.5 Endometriosis is further influenced by ovarian hormone fluctuations and dynamic
inflammatory changes in the ‘ectopically’ located endometriotic tissues, that can lead to changes in the temporal pattern of any pain and a wide range of symptoms that can be
challenging to manage. As a result, these issues can have a
negative impact on all aspects of a woman’s life and her
wellbeing and may have wider implications for ongoing
management.
The latest epidemiological data from the UK suggest 1
in 10 women may have endometriosis although the international prevalence remains unclear6 as comprehensive
global endometriosis and mental health research is lacking. Although, even with further epidemiological study,
given endometriosis comprises of subclinical courses and
is frequently subject to misdiagnoses and delayed diagnosis, affirming prevalence with ‘real-world’ data could be
challenging.
The relationship between endometriosis and MH issues
have been reported differently across a variety of studies. In
addition, the perception of CPP or pain disorders such as
dyspareunia, their reporting and impact on MH symptoms
remain complex to evaluate, although there is some evidence to suggest they could lead to the development of
mood disorders.7,8 Laganà et al.7 demonstrated an association between psychiatric disorders such as depression, somatization and anxiety among endometriosis patients. Given
the presentation of endometriosis, it is very likely to
adversely affect women’s MH, although theories around
the pathophysiology and mechanism remain underresearched and unclear.9 The long-term consequences of
restricted preoperative psychosocial evaluations and the
lack of ongoing psychological support after surgery could
be far reaching. Similarly, delayed or under diagnosed
endometriosis could cause MH issues. Therefore, the overall quality of life of women with endometriosis is at risk
and it has been reported that the potential for increased incidence in depression may be significant.10
Current published research indicates a strong link
between mental and physical health,11 although most
chronic conditions are not well evaluated holistically.
As per guidelines from the American Society for
Reproductive Medicine, it is argued that women with
endometriosis require lifelong personalized management plans.12 However, similar guidelines are not available globally. In order to achieve such recommendations,
further knowledge of the prevalence of the MH sequalae
would be required.

Methods
An evidence synthesis protocol was developed as part of a
systematic methodology. As part of this evidence synthesis,
a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the current
knowledge gap around MH outcomes within endometriosis patients, to help develop evidence based clinical guidelines and inform the design and conduct of future research.
There are many different types of evidence synthesis methodologies that could be used, although these are mostly
non-standardized and non-specific to research associated
with sequalae where a primary and secondary health condition is evaluated. Therefore, we developed a multi-analysis
method. The systematic review protocol was developed in
accordance with the International Prospective Register of
Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) on the 15 July 2020
(CRD42020181495) with an eligibility criteria that is relevant to the clinical research question.

Research question/aims
The primary aim was to determine the prevalence of the
MH sequalae in endometriosis (symptoms and/or psychiatric disorders), including any indirect covariates.

Data extraction
The search strategy comprised of the use of multiple
MeSH and key terms such as Mental Health, Depression,
Anxiety, Mental Health and Endometriosis, Biopolar,
Psychological disorders, Psychological distress, PostTraumatic-Stress-Disorder (PTSD), Psychosis, Mental
wellbeing and Mood disorders. A snowball method was
applied using these MeSH and key terms to identify any
other relevant studies from within citation lists. Grey literature was reviewed to better evaluate patient reported
outcomes although these were not included in the paper
due to the lack of peer review available. Multiple databases were used, including PubMed, PROSPERO,
EMBASE, ProQuest, BIOSIS, Science direct, Ovid
MEDLINE and ClinicalTrials.gov. Variables of any MH
symptomatology and/or psychiatric comorbidity were
used as part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria for this
study. Studies that reported both MH outcomes as a primary endpoint and any associated pain which demonstrated psychological distress were included. All
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs published in English between the 1 November 1995 and 30
November 2020 were included.
Multiple analysis methods were completed on the final
systematically gathered dataset. Studies that may be
excluded from the meta-analysis were analysed narratively. The data collection was completed using Endnote.
An independent reviewer was used to evaluate the initial
dataset as well as the final analysis (Table 1).

Quality assessment
All studies identified within this review were cross-sectional studies. As such, it was important to assess the risk
of bias, reliability of the analysis and validity of the evaluation conducted. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was
used to conduct this assessment. NOS allows 9 points of
risk bias assessment associated with the study group, comparability within the groups based on outcomes as well as
exposure and outcomes (Table 2).

NOS: Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.
*Quality of the included cross-sectional studies was measured using the
modified Newcastle-Ottawa Measurement Scale specific for crosssectional studies.
We rated the quality of the studies (good, fair and poor) by allocating
each domain with stars in this manner:
• A good quality score was awarded 3 or 4 stars in selection, 1 or 2
in comparability, and 2 or 3 stars in outcomes.
• A fair quality score was awarded 2 stars in selection, 1 or 2 stars in
comparability, and 2 or 3 stars in outcomes.
• A poor quality score was allocated 0 or 1 star(s) in selection, 0
stars in comparability, and 0 or 1 star(s) in outcomes domain in line
with the NOS guidelines.

An independent reviewer appraised the risk of bias
and methodological quality in accordance to the NOS
that has validity for use in cohort studies and the adapted
version by Modesti and colleagues (2016) was used for
cross-sectional studies. An eight item scale with three
quality parameters of (1) selection, (2) comparability and
(3) outcome. The quality of the studies were rated (good,
fair and poor) by allocating each domain with stars in this
manner:
•• A Good quality score was awarded 3 or 4 stars in
selection, 1 or 2 in comparability, and 2 or 3 stars in
outcomes.
•• A Fair quality score was awarded 2 stars in selection, 1 or 2 stars in comparability, and 2 or 3 stars in
outcomes.
•• A Poor quality score was allocated 0 or 1 star(s) in
selection, 0 stars in comparability, and 0 or 1 star(s)
in outcomes domain.

Data synthesis
For prevalence estimation, summary statistics were
extracted from studies that reported MH outcomes in
women with endometriosis or chronic pain or CPP. These
statistics were either prevalence or mean (standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile range (IQR).
Estimates for studies that reported median and IQR were
converted to mean and SD. For studies that did not report
prevalence rates but reported only mean (SD) or median
(IQR) we employed Monte Carlo simulations to estimate
the proportion of the outcome based on appropriate cut-off
points for the tool used to measure the outcome (a score of
19 for BDI and 8 for HADS).13–15 We assumed normality
of the distribution when mean (SD) were reported or the
data were symmetrical.
Estimate pooled prevalence were calculated for anxiety
and depression, CPP, and dyspareunia for which purpose we
used a random-effects model. We also used a random effect
model to compute pooled estimate of mean score of CPP
measured using SF-MPQ and compute prevalence ratios of
anxiety and depression. We used the I2 statistic to assess heterogeneity between the studies for which the cut-off values
for degree of heterogeneity were – 25% for low, 50% for
moderate, and 75% for high.16 To investigate sources of heterogeneity we conducted sensitivity analyses for outcomes
that had sufficient sample size for these analyses. These
included estimate of prevalence of depression by excluding
a lone study where participants were enrolled from primary
care and another analysis that included only cross-sectional
studies. We were able to assess potential publication bias
through visualization of funnel plot and Egger’s test for only
depression since it was the only outcome with ⩾ 10 studies.
Analysis was conducted using STATA 14.0.
A total of 34 cross-sectional studies were finalized for the
systematic review, although 12 were included into the metaanalysis. The 12 studies reported depression, anxiety, CPP,

Depression

dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea. The remaining studies were
reviewed as part of the thematic and narrative analysis.

We found the prevalence of depressive symptoms among
women with endometriosis to be 28.9% (95% CI: 8.6%–
49.2%) (Figure 2(b)). When we included only the studies
that used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) to assess
depressive symptoms we did not find the results to be
materially different from the overall estimate (prevalence:
24.8%, 95% CI: 10.1%–39.4%) (Supplemental Figure 1).
Analysis conducted after excluding a study that enrolled
patients from primary care instead of tertiary care/women’s clinics/university hospital/gynaecological clinics
resulted in little change to the prevalence estimate
(Supplemental Figure 2). However, meta-analysis of only
cross-sectional studies resulted in a lower prevalence compared to the overall estimate (22.0% vs 28.9%)
(Supplemental Figure 3). Meta-analysis of three studies
did not reveal strong evidence of higher prevalence of

Meta-analysis
Anxiety. The prevalence for anxiety symptoms was found
to be 31.8% (95% CI: 26.5% - 37.1%) (Figure 2(a)). We
were able to pool five studies to compute prevalence ratios.
The prevalence of anxiety symptoms was 2.8 times higher
among women who had endometriosis compared to
women without endometriosis (Figure 3(a)). A prospective cohort study that was not included in the meta-analysis17 reported 44% increased risk for anxiety for women
with endometriosis compared to women without endometriosis. The same study reported a hazard ratio of 1.39
(95%CI: 1.14, 1.71) for anxiety among women with endometriosis who were < 40 years of age and 1.53 (95%CI:
1.15, 2.04) for women who were ⩾ 40 years of age.

Other outcomes
The pooled prevalence for CPP was high at 57.2% (95%
CI: 7.0%–107.4%) (Figure 4(a)). We found the pooled
estimate of mean SF-MPQ for chronic pain to be 13.09
(95% CI: 7.13–19.05) (Supplemental Figure 4). The other
outcome for which we were able to compute prevalence
was dyspareunia which was found to be high too at 54.9%
(95% CI: 43.9%–65.9%) (Figure 4(b)). Six studies that
reported anxiety among BAME women with endometriosis were identified, therefore it was not possible to complete a meta-analysis.

Studies that were excluded from the meta-analysis were
still part of the systematic review and therefore were used
as part of the thematic and narrative analysis included
within the discussion.

Publication bias
Funnel plot suggested evidence for publication bias
with a tendency for studies with low prevalence rates
for depression to be not published (Supplemental Figure
5). However, the p-value for Egger’s test for funnel
asymmetry was found to be 0.50 suggesting insufficient
evidence to test for publication bias, probably due to
low power (only 11 studies included) to detect such a
bias.

Narrative analysis
The translation of analytical and descriptive themes are
important to facilitate transparency of reporting qualitative
and quantitative data. Based on all 34 papers identified
systematically, anxiety, depression, CPP and dyspareunia
were identified as recurring themes reported by all the
studies. In addition, a range of other non-standardized variables were identified as demonstrated in Table 3. However,
the data were unclear regarding the prevalence of symptoms versus clinical diagnoses, which hinders a full assessment of the short, medium and long-term implications for
patients and healthcare systems. The identification of CPP
and dyspareunia in particular purports further impact on
patients’ MH, as highlighted by Till et al.18 Women with

CPP are reported to have significant rates of psychological
disorders in comparison to those without CPP.18 Bryant
et al.19 further reported that in their outpatient clinics for
CPP, over 50% of patients had moderate to severe anxiety
while over 25% had moderate to severe depression.
Symptoms such as anxiety and depression may share a
symbiotic relationship which may be exacerbated among
endometriosis women that use opioids due to CPP.
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) has been found to be
more common in patients with CPP or any type of pain
disorder or symptomatology associated with a primary
condition such as endometriosis. Bryant et al.19 reported
patients with CPP demonstrate 30%–73% with anxiety
which is 3 to 7 times higher in comparison to the general
population which is around 12%.20

GAD causes pervasive worries which can be coupled
with muscle tension or fatigue that impact other endometriosis symptoms.
Dyspareunia is a key feature of sexual pain disorders
and CPP. It is also a cardinal feature of endometriosis,21
and is connected with various other gynaecological conditions such as infertility. However, this meta-analysis has
demonstrated that despite a high prevalence of CPP, the
assessment tools used in most trials are inadequate and its
association with dyspareunia is unclear. Furthermore,
while it is agreed most endometriosis patients may have
‘deep dyspareunia’, it is challenging to confirm this clinically. Self-administered measures of pain (e.g. the McGill
Pain Questionnaire22) and its impact on sexual function
(e.g. Female Sexual Function Index,23 Female Sexual
Distress Scale24), and psychological (e.g. Beck Depression

Inventory-II,25 Beck Anxiety Inventory26) and relationship
adjustment (e.g. Dyadic Adjustment Scale,27 the LockeWallace Marital Adjustment Test28) are some of the tools
that have been used. These assessment questionnaires are
often nonspecific for CPP. There is scant evidence that the
current assessment tools provide meaningful clinical
results in patients suffering from CPP as a consequence of
endometriosis. The pain assessment tools are not universally used for CPP suffers and this can be attributed to lack
of evidence and a clear guidance for its use.
Surgically diagnosed endometriosis patients may have
a better probability of confirming symptomatologies of
dyspareunia. Inadequate assessments could be one reason
for the current difficulties in identifying and managing
these symptoms, that could lead to psychological distress
which could further impact physical and mental wellbeing.

Delanerolle et al.
This in turn could make the provision of the clinical care of
CPP cumbersome. The EUA guidelines on management of
persistent CPP after appropriate medical treatment recommends an approach focussed on managing pain, via integrated medical and psychological care. Patients with
pelvic pain differ substantially in the extent they will volunteer information about emotional and behavioural
aspects of pain.29 One way to address this would be to
introduce a tool for early assessment of pain and any associated psychosocial impact, that incorporates long-term
monitoring that could support clinical management.
A total of 17 papers reported the impact of endometriosis on generalized quality of life (QoL) using the Short
Form Health Survey-36 and 12 (SF36 and SF 12) and also
using assessments specific to endometriosis (Endometriosis
Health Profile-30 and EHP-30 and EHP-5). These studies
(which were not included in the meta-analysis) demonstrated a reduction in QoL,29–34 with a few patients reporting their experience to be ‘worse than death’.35 However,
these QoL assessments were not conducted in conjunction
with any MH assessments.

Discussion
In order to better characterize the MH sequelae of endometriosis, it is equally important to understand the pathogenesis of the disease which is driven by an oestrogen
dependency and its association with the central feature,
CPP. Sensitisation to pain varies across women with the
disease, which may alter their behaviour due to changes
within the electrophysiology of the brain. Li et al.36 tested
their theory of endometriosis and change in the electrophysiology and found a number of genes were involved
with pain, locomotion and anxiety. They concluded that
endometriosis associated pain sensitisation, depression
and anxiety all altered the electrophysiology of the brain.36
Furthermore, Tokushige et al.37 demonstrated that nerve
fibres within the functional layer of the endometrium and
ectopic endometriosis lesions were nociceptive within
clinical studies. Thus, nascent endometriosis specific neuropathological involvement could have a wider effect on
neuronal behaviour within the central neural system
(CNS) and influence pain sensitisation among patients,
and it could be argued that this may impact the electrophysiology of the brain further.38 In addition, in CPP associated with endometriosis, endometriotic lesions elicit
increases in prostaglandin, cytokine and growth factor
concentrations inducing a unique neural and vascular
implantation process via neuroangiogenesis.38 Overall,
these mechanisms appear to be complex in nature and
remain unclear. In addition to this, further evidence of the
CNS involvement has been reported by Agarwal and
Subramanian39 including two cases of cerebral endometriosis with cystic masses in the cerebellar vermis. As a
result of these factors, there are potential neuropsychiatric

13
mechanisms to consider. All this only emphasizes the
need to better characterize and understand the MH
sequalae among endometriosis patients. To do this, comprehensive assessment tools maybe required to better
characterize and report MH symptoms and clinical features through patient reported outcomes.
Four of the 34 studies identified used a validated, clinical diagnostic assessment to diagnose psychiatric disorders. Kumar et al.40 described 37% of the endometriosis
group and 50% of the pelvic pain group having a familial
history of mood disorders although, they were not taking
any GnRH agonist treatments. Pharmacological, surgical
or psychosocial interventions and potential associations
were not identified within these studies.41
To fully explore QoL among endometriosis patients, the
mechanistic nature and role of MH difficulties should be
explored in the first instance. Current QoL data are probably not reflective of the true individual disease burden in
the short, medium or long-term. QoL data should also be
used to develop suitable health economic models (HEMs)
for endometriosis and its associated comorbidities. Without
this, it is not feasible to evaluate the true health and social
care cost of endometriosis and its relevance to the MH
sequalae shared with endometriosis. Thus, there still
remains a significant gap in understanding the actual cost
implications of MH symptoms in endometriosis on clinical
services. Research into this area appears to be absent
although, some studies have attempted to evaluate HEMs
for endometriosis using estimated costs, despite the lack of
comprehensive prevalence data.
Use of qualitative or quantitative methods alone may
not suffice to inform the knowledge and practice based
requirements in endometriosis, because of the complex
characteristics demonstrated among this population of
patients. This is also apparent in grey literature.
In this meta-analysis, majority of the data were on
prevalence, although the sample sizes were limited, preventing any sub-group analysis being conducted on age
groups, ethnicity and geographical location. Most studies
did not report these aspects, therefore, a sub-group analysis was not conducted. In addition to this, a compute odds
ratio was conducted despite a small number of studies,
that indicated insufficient evidence within the literature
to identify the effects of endometriosis on MH in the
short, medium and long-term. This further reinforces the
need for comprehensive clinical research to be conducted
that would enable the results to be generalized to the
wider population.
Across most studies, a recurring theme is patients’ experiences of pain, dyspareunia, irregular bleeding and infertility. While endometriosis is associated with infertility, QoL
of patients could be impacted in a number of ways including their psychological wellbeing. Most papers report on
both severe and progressive pain during menstruation and
in pre- and post-menstruation phases. Symptomatologies

14
such as fatigue, tiredness, sleep disturbances, bowel and
bladder symptoms have been reported. As a result of these
symptoms, there is also a reported impact on a woman’s
mental wellbeing, and women frequently experience and
report depression and anxiety. Empirical research also suggests an exacerbation of MH symptoms due to a delayed
diagnosis and the heightened experiences of severe symptoms that remained clinically undermanaged. Prolonged
low-dose hormonal contraception or progestogens, offered
as first-line treatment, may in turn aggravate the risk of MH
problems.42
There was also a theme that indicated endometriosis
impacted intimate relationships. This has been suggested
to be between 33.5% and 71%,29,43 largely as a result of
CPP and dyspareunia. Bernuit et al.29 across-country study
indicated 24–25% women within their endometriosis population experienced dyspareunia. However, the precise
MH impact of this and the possible association with symptoms such as low mood was unreported. It is further evident that the impact of endometriosis on women’s partners
remains unexplored and requires further research.44,45
A distinctive feature reported by researchers and
patients alike within these papers is CPP. As a result of
endometriosis-associated pain, women may have reduced
physical functioning that may affect mobility long-term, as
well increase their risk for other health conditions such as
diabetes. Simoens et al.35 reported between 16% and 61%43
of women with endometriosis reported challenges with
daily activities, including self-care. However, based on
these studies, it is unclear if the reported deterioration and
ongoing difficulties with MH is as a direct result of the
decline in activities or other underlying disorders.
Interestingly, Nnoaham et al.46 demonstrated a considerable reduction in physical health among endometriosis
patients in comparison to the rest of the population.
Based on this evidence, it appears endometriosis
patients have significant MH symptoms such as depression and anxiety, although the relative clinical significance
within a generalisable population remains unclear. In order
to provide optimal care to endometriosis patients, MH difficulties need to be taken into account by clinical teams,
and based on this evidence, it is unlikely a uniformal holistic approach is currently being used, or at least reported by
all global healthcare systems. As a result of this, a wider
evaluation of the MH sequalae of endometriosis is required.

Limitations
The primary limitations of this review is the small number of
studies included in the meta-analysis. This evidence synthesis is based on cross-sectional studies only. Cross-sectional
data often lacks directionality and provides no insight into
mechanistic associations or causal effects between endometriosis and MH issues. Furthermore, poor quality data was a
concern, as was the lack of psychiatric diagnostic data, and

Women’s Health﻿
some studies were excluded on this basis. There was moderate-to-high heterogeneity for the studies included in the overall prevalence estimates of anxiety (I2 = 73%) and depression
(I2 = 99%). We could not, however, thoroughly investigate
sources of heterogeneity due the limited number of studies
included in the analysis (especially for CPP and dyspareunia
prevalence estimate). Another limitation is that, the results of
the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution given
that it is based on small number of studies for each outcome,
but this also throws light on the fact that there is a gap in the
literature on MH disorders in women with endometriosis.

Discussion
This paper highlights the prevalence of MH sequalae in
endometriosis. But a key finding of the review is that the
pain and MH assessments used have considerable variability, and lack specificity. As a result, this could contribute to
a significant knowledge and practice gap.
Most studies describe stress-related disorders, eating
disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorders and personality disorders as being common among women with
endometriosis and some even suggest familial liability,
although the mechanistic causation requires to be investigated further as the generalizability of this data remains
poor.
Overall, psychiatric comorbidities remain unreported
and unsubstantiated with the exception of a study reporting
reduced psychological functioning and QoL as a result of
MH difficulties,41 when the authors reported that 56.4% of
women with endometriosis fulfilled the clinical criteria for
psychiatric disorders.
While we acknowledge pain and MH disorders are
complex conditions independently, they appear to share an
overlapping sequalae with endometriosis. However, the
pathophysiology of this construct remains to be seen. It is
important that future research conducted should comprise
of larger sample sizes that could be generalisable to the
wider population, as well as psychiatric diagnostic assessments. In order to evaluate, diagnose and treat endometriosis in a holistic manner, it is vital to understand the
applicability of existing instruments and whether these
could be harmonized even when varied methods and settings use these. Finally, the MH burden associated with
endometriosis and its associated pain disorders should be
determined to improve clinical practices.

Conclusion
This SR demonstrated that the most common type of MH
symptoms and psychiatric comorbidities reported in
patients with endometriosis are anxiety and depression.
However, there were a large proportion of studies with
poor study designs and small sample sizes, therefore,
these outcomes may not be reflective of the wider

Delanerolle et al.

15

population. These studies also failed to differentiate MH
symptoms from psychiatric disorders. Overall, the prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities among the endometriosis populations remains significantly unresearched.
Interim clinical plans to address these disturbances remain
inconclusive due to the lack of association data from epidemiological studies between CPP, endometriosis and
MH issues. This paper also demonstrates that the current
literature is insufficient to establish either a unidirectional
and/or a bidirectional causality between endometriosis
and MH problems. It is vital to acknowledge the importance of conducting comprehensive and statistically significant research to further the understanding of the
association of endometriosis and MH issues. This would
further the management of this complex, and life long,
multifaceted condition.
