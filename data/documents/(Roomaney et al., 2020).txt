ABSTRACT

ARTICLE HISTORY

We examined biopsychosocial predictors of symptoms of
depression in women with endometriosis. The sample consisted of 202 women with endometriosis who completed a
battery of measures including a demographic questionnaire,
Beck Depression Inventory, Stellenbosch Endometriosis Quality
of life Menstrual characteristics subscale, Short form health
survey Physical functioning subscale, and three modular components of the Endometriosis Health Profile 30, namely the
Sexual Relationships, Feelings about the Medical Profession,
and Feelings about Infertility modules. About 43.1% of the
sample reported moderate to severe symptoms of depression.
Physical functioning, feelings about the medical profession
and sexual relationships were significant predictors of symptoms of depression. The identification of these predictors may
enable researchers and practitioners to identify patients to be
screened for depression, e.g., patients who report sub-optimal
physical functioning, negative feelings about the medical profession and difficult sexual relationships.

Background

Endometriosis is a painful, chronic illness that affects 10–15% women of
reproductive age (Eskenazi & Warner, 1997). The disease is physiologically
defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterus
(Kennedy et al., 2005). Its primary symptoms are chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea (painful periods), infertility, dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse), and heavy menstrual bleeding (Mao & Anastasi, 2010; Sinaii et al.,
2008). Endometriosis can only be definitively diagnosed following a laparoscopy (Farquhar, 2007), making its true prevalence difficult to assess
(Dancet et al., 2011). Women with endometriosis report poor quality of life
(Facchin et al., 2015; Petrelluzzi, Garcia, Petta, Grassi-Kassisse, & SpadariBratfisch, 2008; Roomaney & Kagee, 2018a; Siedentopf, Tariverdian, R€

Kentenich, & Arck, 2008), including compromised psychological and occupational well-being, social participation, and their sexual and intimate relationships (Culley, Law, et al., 2013; Gilmour, Huntington, & Wilson, 2008).
In this study, we examined the psychosocial predictors of symptoms of
depression in women with endometriosis.

Depression

Depressive symptoms have been associated with other pain disorders such
as fibromyalgia (Gracely, Ceko & Bushnell, 2012), chronic pelvic pain
(Coelho et al., 2014), and rheumatoid arthritis (Matcham, Rayner, Steer, &
Hotopf, 2013). Endometriosis is a chronic pain disorder and patients may
experience depression due to the chronic nature of the illness. A systematic
review concluded that relationships exist between endometriosis and anxiety, depression, psychosocial stress, and quality of life. However, these
studies merely examined correlations between variables (Pope, Sharma,
Sharma, & Mazmanian, 2015). In most studies, women with endometriosis
reported elevated symptoms of depression (Chen et al., 2016; Eriksen et al.,
2008; Lagana et al., 2015; Lorençatto, Petta, Navarro, Bahamondes, &
Matos, 2006; Roth, Punch, & Bachman, 2011; Rush & Misajon, 2018;
Sepulcri & Amaral, 2009). When comparing women with endometriosis to
those without endometriosis, but with chronic pelvic pain, no differences
in depressive symptoms and distress were found (Roth et al., 2011). In
another study among patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery for either
endometriosis or benign masses, those with endometriosis reported significantly higher levels of depression compared to those with benign masses
(Lagana et al., 2015). A recent meta-analysis of 24 studies concluded that
patients with endometriosis and chronic pain reported significantly higher
levels of depression than endometriosis without chronic pelvic pain, but
their depressive symptoms were not significantly different to patients with
chronic pelvic pain who were not diagnosed with depression (Gambadauro,
Carli, & Hadlaczky, 2019).
Findings related to the relationship between disease stage and symptoms
of depression are also contradictory. Among a sample of 38 patients, those
diagnosed with stage III and stage IV endometriosis reported higher scores
on the German version of the Center for Epidemiological studies depression scale than those with stages I and II (Siedentopf et al., 2008). Yet, this
finding could not be replicated among 63 patients with endometriosis,
using the Beck Depression Inventory (Eriksen et al., 2008). It appears therefore that the relationship between depression and endometriosis is complex
and warrants further investigation.

Menstrual cycle

The relationship between women’s menstrual cycles and mood disturbance
has been an area of interest to researchers. The American Psychiatric
Association has recognized premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) as a
mood disorder in the DSM-5. A diagnosis of PMDD requires that the
mood disturbance be confined to the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle
and dissipate at the start of the menstrual cycle (Epperson et al., 2012).
PMDD remains a controversial entity, with Feminists questioning the validity of the disorder (Cosgrove & Wheeler, 2013; Di Giulio &
Reissing, 2006).
While literature on the menstrual cycle and mood disruption is abundant, there is a paucity of research on the relationship between menstrual
irregularities (i.e., heavy/abnormal bleeding) and depressive symptoms. The
literature indicates somewhat contradictory findings regarding this relationship. For example, a study conducted among 934 women found that
women with a past history of major depression were more likely to report
heavy bleeding than those with recent major depression (Bromberger et al.,
2012). However, another study conducted in the USA (n ¼ 628) did not
find any relationship between current or lifetime major depression and
menstrual cycle length or regularity (Barron, Flick, Cook, Homan, &
Campbell, 2008). More research is therefore required regarding the relationship between menstrual characteristics and depressive symptoms. We
hypothesized that menstrual symptoms were a predictor of symptoms
of depression.
Pain and physical functioning

It is common for endometriosis patients to report that pain limits their
physical functioning (Moradi, Parker, Sneddon, Lopez, & Ellwood, 2014;
Petrelluzzi et al., 2008). These limitations are related to walking, exercise,
prolonged sitting, and day-to-day activity. Other factors such as not having
children, hysterectomy, age and pain catastrophizing have been identified
as significant predictors of pelvic pain (Carey, Martin, Siedhoff, Bair, & AsSanie, 2014; Martin, Johnson, Wechter, Leserman, & Zolnoun, 2011).
Studies concerning other conditions found that physical limitations predicted symptoms of depression in patients (Kendel et al., 2010; Stegenga
et al., 2012). While studies show that pelvic pain is associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression (Kendel et al., 2010; Sepulcri & Amaral,
2009), no studies have investigated physical limitations as a predictor of
depression among patients with endometriosis. Considering the impact of
endometriosis on physical functioning and the relationship between physical functioning and depression in non-endometriosis participants as cited

HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL

311

above, we hypothesized that physical limitations would predict symptoms
of depression in patients with endometriosis.
Interactions with medical professionals

To our knowledge, only one study reported a relationship between mood
change and dissatisfaction with medical professionals, although the directionality of this relationship is unclear (Bui, Ostir, Kuo, Freeman, &
Goodwin, 2005). Dissatisfaction with health care and medical treatment is
widely reported among women with endometriosis (Cox, Henderson,
Wood, & Cagliarini, 2003; Jones, Jenkinson, & Kennedy, 2004; Moradi
et al., 2014). Health-care-related dissatisfaction for women with endometriosis has been attributed to the challenge of finding doctors who take
patients’ reports of symptoms seriously and sympathetically (Cox,
Henderson, Andersen, Cagliarini, & Ski, 2003; Cox, Henderson, Wood,
et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2004). Skepticism and mistrust of doctors have
been reported as a barrier to adherence to medical advice by women with
endometriosis (Seear, 2009). Another factor related to this dissatisfaction is
the delay in diagnosis, which may lead to poor disease management.
Patients from the UK reported an 8 year delay in diagnosis from the time
they started seeking treatment till they were diagnosed (Cox, Henderson,
Wood, et al., 2003). A study in Germany and Austria reported a 10.4-year
delay (Hudelist et al., 2012). We hypothesized that relationships with medical professionals were a significant predictors of symptoms of depression.
Sexual functioning

Patients with endometriosis reported experiencing less satisfying sex lives
and relationships than their counterparts without endometriosis (Rossi
et al., 2008). In addition, women with endometriosis reported poorer sexual
functioning than healthy controls (Di Donato et al., 2015; Giuliani et al.,
2016). This sexual dysfunction may be attributed to dyspareunia, which is
an important symptom of endometriosis. Dyspareunia is classified as a genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder in the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric
Association, 2013) thus recognizing that most sexual dysfunctions may be
caused by biological and psychological factors (Latif & Diamond, 2013).
A reduction in dyspareunia may be indicative that a specific treatment is
effective. Studies have demonstrated that interventions such as Dienogest
(a progestin) and laparoscopic surgery with and without excision of endometriosis significantly improved sexual functioning in women with endometriosis (Caruso et al., 2015; Ferrero, Abbamonte, Giordano, Ragni, &
Remorgida, 2007; Lukic et al., 2016; Van Den Broeck et al., 2013).

312

R. ROOMANEY ET AL.

The relationship between sexual dysfunction and depression is a bi-directional one (Atlantis & Sullivan, 2012). For example, sexual dysfunction was
identified as a predictor of depressive symptoms in women receiving hemodialysis in Brazil (Santos et al., 2013), whereas another study found that
depression was a significant predictor of sexual dysfunction among women
with epilepsy in the Czech Republic (Zelena, Kuba, Soska, & Rektor, 2011).
Furthermore, research shows that the burden of sexual dysfunction is carried by women as dyspareunia and depressive symptoms were associated
with impaired sexual functioning in women with endometriosis but did not
affect their male partners (De Graaff, Van Lankveld, Smits, Van Beek, &
Dunselman, 2016). We hypothesized that sexual dysfunction would be a
significant predictor of symptoms of depression.
Infertility

The prevalence of infertility is high among women with endometriosis,
with studies reporting rates ranging between 25% and 50% (Meuleman,
D’Hoore, Van Cleynenbreugel, Beks, & D’Hooghe, 2009; Ozkan, Murk, &
Arici, 2008). A longitudinal study found that 75.6% of a sample of women
diagnosed with endometriosis were able to produce a child within a 15year period (Fagervold, Jenssen, Hummelshoj, & Moen, 2009). In vitro fertilization (IVF) is considered to be the most effective method to assist
women with endometriosis to conceive (Macer & Taylor, 2012). Medical
scientists previously believed that hormones associated with IVF result in
disease progression in women with endometriosis, but recent studies disputed this (Benaglia et al., 2011; Santulli et al., 2016).
The psychosocial impact of infertility is significant and has emerged in a
number of studies among women with endometriosis (Culley, Law, et al.,
2013; Denny & Barr, 2004; Jones et al., 2004; Markovic, Manderson, &
Warren, 2008). Women with endometriosis and infertility reported that
infertility negatively affected their relationships with partners (Jones et al.,
2004). Women with endometriosis stated that infertility is a major concern
for them and this concern has resulting in couples feeling compelled to
start their families prematurely (Culley, Law, et al., 2013; Markovic
et al., 2008).
Endometriosis patients have reported receiving conflicting information
regarding fertility and endometriosis from doctors (Young, Fisher, &
Kirkman, 2016). While some women were satisfied with the information
they received from doctors regarding endometriosis and fertility, others
were dissatisfied and stated that they received inappropriate and inefficient
information and that in some cases doctors prioritized their fertility without consulting them (Young et al., 2016). We hypothesized that feelings

HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL

313

about infertility would be a significant predictor of symptoms
of depression.
Currently, there is a paucity of endometriosis-related research from
developing countries (Young, Fisher, & Kirkman, 2015). There are no
prevalence rates for endometriosis in South Africa and little psychosocial
research has been conducted into the experiences of women with endometriosis and their psychological well-being in this context. Mental health is an
important aspect of quality of life and research indicates that there is a substantial negative impact in work productivity for women with endometriosis (Klein et al., 2014). Furthermore, while the studies cited above indicate
that relationships exist between endometriosis, symptoms of depression,
physical functioning, infertility, and sexual dysfunction, only one study has
investigated psychosocial predictors of distress (anxiety and depressive
symptoms) in women with endometriosis (Facchin et al., 2017). These
authors reported that pelvic pain severity, self-esteem, body esteem, and
emotional self-efficacy were associated with psychological outcomes and
mental health. However, the authors noted that their findings were limited
due to the exclusion of variables such as infertility, pregnancy, and sexual
dysfunction as predictors of distress (Facchin et al., 2017).
In this article, we sought to examine the biopsychosocial predictors of
symptoms of depression in a sample of women with endometriosis in
South Africa. The predictors examined were medical variables namely,
menstrual characteristics and physical functioning and psychosocial predictors namely, feelings about infertility, sexual functioning, and satisfaction
with treatment. We hypothesized that all the above variables would be significant predictors of symptoms of depression.
Methods
Research design and setting

This study was conducted in South Africa. We used a cross-sectional
research design and collected data over a period of 11 months. We used
convenience sampling to recruit participants from two public hospitals and
several private health-care facilities.
Participants

In order to participate in the study, women had to be 18 years or older,
have been laparoscopically diagnosed with endometriosis by a doctor, and
reported experiencing symptoms of endometriosis. Patients who were diagnosed with other chronic illnesses (including psychiatric illnesses) and
asymptomatic endometriosis patients were excluded from the study. We

314

R. ROOMANEY ET AL.

included women who were on treatment or had a hysterectomy, provided
that they experienced symptoms of endometriosis.
A sample of 138 participants would have been sufficient for analysis. We
recruited a sample consisting of 202 women with endometriosis.
Participants’ ages ranged from 19 to 64 years (M ¼ 34.94 years, SD ¼ 7.04).
Most of the participants were married (n ¼ 121, 59.9%), did not have children (n ¼ 123, 63.4%), and were employed on a fulltime basis (n ¼ 123,
65.9%). Most of the participants were recruited at public health-care facilities (n ¼ 136, 67.32%). Participants’ highest level of education varied, with
2 reporting that they received no formal education, 5 reported that they
completed grade 7, 34 stated that they entered high school, but did not
graduate from high school (i.e., complete grade 12), and 58 participants
stated that they completed grade 12. Several participants received some tertiary education, with 25 participants reporting that they did not complete
their tertiary studies, and 75 women reported that they completed tertiary
education. Participants annual household income varied, with most participants (n ¼ 60) earning between 345 USD and 7570 USD per year. Several
(n ¼ 51) participants did not report their income, 28 reported earnings
below 345 USD per year, and 30 reported earnings above 20645USD
per year.
Most participants (n ¼ 93) did not know the stage of their endometriosis.
Several participants reported having stage 4 endometriosis (n ¼ 66), while
fewer participants reported having stages 1 (n ¼ 7), 2 (n ¼ 13), and 3
(n ¼ 15). Most participants reported that they were not using any form of
medical treatment for their endometriosis (n ¼ 113). Twenty-five women
reported that they were seeking fertility treatment at the time of data collection. Two participants reported that they had a hysterectomy but that
they continued to have symptoms of endometriosis.

Procedures

We recruited participants using two methods. First, nurses handed a flyer
to patients advertising the project to potential participants meeting the
inclusion criteria. Patients who were interested in finding out more about
the project completed a contact permission form and handed it back to the
nurses. This form allowed a researcher to contact participants and explain
the study to them. We made appointments to meet with the patients who
indicated that they were willing to participate in the study. The second
method of recruitment was by means of telephonic invitations to participate in the study. A research nurse at one of the public health-care hospitals telephoned patients with endometriosis and invited them to participate

HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL

315

in the study. Similarly, research assistants made appointments with patients
interested in participating in the study.
A team of research assistants oversaw data collection with participants. The
research assistants met with the participants and informed them of the study.
Once written informed consent was granted, the research assistants handed
the participants a booklet containing the battery of measures. The measures
were only available in English and took approximately 40 minutes to complete. The participants completed the measures during the meeting and
handed it back to the research assistants. The assistants checked the data for
completeness and asked participants to provide any missing information.
This resulted in no missing data. The participants received a gift voucher as a
token of appreciation for participating in the study. The study received ethical
clearance and approval from the relevant research Ethics Committee.
Instruments

Demographic questionnaire: A demographic questionnaire was used to
record general information relating to age, relationship status, number of
children, living situation, employment status, and income. Information
regarding their illness such as disease stage, time since diagnosis, treatment
type, and treatment site was also obtained.
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI): The BDI was used to assess symptoms
of depression (Beck, Ward, Mendelson, Mock, & Erbaugh, 1961). The
measure consists of 21 items and uses a four-point rating scale. Scores
range from 0 to 63, with scores above 10 indicating clinical depression.
The scale has been adapted and standardized for various cultural groups
within South Africa. An internal consistency reliability of .94 was obtained
in the current sample.
Stellenbosch Endometriosis Quality of life (SEQOL) Menstrual characteristics
subscale: The SEQOL is a HRQOL measure consisting of eight subscales,
including the menstrual characteristics subscale. The measure was developed
in the South African context using a sequential mixed methods study
(Roomaney & Kagee, 2018b). The Menstrual Characteristics subscale is a
unique subscale that measures concerns that women have regarding their
menstrual cycle. The subscale contains three items that assess women’s concerns about clotting, how ‘normal’ they thought their periods were, and the
extent to which women experience their periods as draining. Higher scores
indicate more concerns regarding the menstrual cycle than lower scores. This
subscale produced an internal consistency score of .82 in the current sample.
The Short form healthy survey (SF-12v2), Physical functioning subscale:
The SF12v2 consists of eight domains, namely physical functioning, bodily
pain, role physical (interference ability to accomplish tasks, goals or

316

R. ROOMANEY ET AL.

activities), general health status, vitality, social role, role emotional, and
mental health (Cruz, Camey, Fleck, & Polanczyk, 2009). These domains
can be clustered to produce general scores for two domains, physical and
psychological domains. The SF12v2 utilizes a Likert response format, with
higher scale scores indicating better QOL compared to lower scores. We
used the software provided, Optum (Optum smart measurement system
scoring solution), to generate scores for these domains of the SF12v2. We
only used the physical domain in our analysis, which asks participants to
reflect on their general health, physical limitations, pain interference,
impact of health of social activities. The internal consistency of this subscale was .66, which is good considering that the subscale consists of only
seven items.
Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP30) Sexual Relationships: This 5-item
modular component of the EHP30 measures women’s feelings and experiences relating to sexual intercourse (Jones, Kennedy, Barnard, Wong, &
Jenkinson, 2001). Items are endorsed using a 5-point Likert scale. Higher
scores represent poorer sexual functioning than lower scores in each subscale. Items measure pain during intercourse as well as fear, avoidance,
guilt, and frustration related to intercourse. This measure produced a high
internal consistency of .94 in the current sample.
EHP30 Feelings about the Medical Profession: This 4-item modular component assesses women’s feeling about the medical profession (Jones et al., 2001).
Test-takers are asked to indicate their impressions of the efficacy of their doctors, the extent to which they feel their doctors take them seriously, frustration
regarding the doctor’s knowledge of endometriosis, and whether they felt as if
they were wasting the doctor’s time. Higher scores represent poorer interactions with medical professionals than lower scores. These items are highly relevant to the endometriosis experience and the measure produced an internal
consistency score of .94 in the current sample.
Endometriosis Health Profile 30 (EHP30): Feelings about Infertility: The
Feelings about Infertility subscale of the EHP30 consists of four items that
assess women’s general worry about being able to conceive, feelings of depression and guilt related to the inability to conceive, and the impact that infertility
has on women’s romantic relationships (Jones et al., 2001). Higher scores represent more negative feelings about infertility than lower scores. The measure
produced a high internal consistency reliability of .97 in the current sample.
Data analysis

We analyzed the data using IBM SPSS version 24 (IBM Corp, 2016). We calculated the Pearson’s product–moment correlation to determine the bivariate
relationships among the variables. Regression diagnostic tests were conducted

HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL

317

and the results indicated that the data were suitable for multivariate analysis.
We then regressed symptoms of depression against the predictor variables.
The predictors were entered into two blocks. The first block related to biological and medical aspects, namely physical functioning and menstrual characteristics. The second block included items related to psychosocial aspects
(i.e., feelings about infertility, the medical profession, and sexual relationships). The variables were entered in this manner as we posited that physical
factors may have a greater influence on symptoms of depression than psychosocial factors.

Table 1 contains the mean scores, standard deviations, and range of scores
of the predictor variables. Participants indicated considerable concern about
their menstruation by reporting high mean scores. They also reported moderate to low physical functioning, as indicated by the physical functioning
score. Participants generally indicated that their interactions with the medical professionals were positive (please refer to Table 2), with very few participants reporting negative experiences with their doctors.
Prevalence of symptoms of depression

Scores on the BDI ranged from 0 to 56 (M ¼ 18.18, SD ¼ 13.08). Table 3

participants. The table indicates that participants reported elevated symptoms of depression.

Results of multiple regression

Table 4 presents the correlation matrix. As can be seen, significant low to
moderate inter-correlations were found between symptoms of depression
and physical functioning (r ¼ .40, p ¼ .00), menstrual characteristics
(r ¼ .25, p ¼ .00), feelings about infertility (r ¼ .20, p ¼ .02), feelings
about the medical profession (r ¼ .32, p ¼ .00), and feelings about sexual
relationships (r ¼ .30, p ¼ .00).
The model fit statistics are presented in Table 5. Both steps in the model
were significant (p ¼ .00). However, the F change statistics of the first
block of model (i.e., the combination of menstrual characteristics and physical functioning) was larger than the second model (i.e., the combination of
menstrual characteristics, physical functioning, infertility, sexual relationships, and feelings about the medical profession). The linear combination
of menstrual characteristics, physical functioning, feelings about infertility,

sexual relationships, and feelings about the medical profession explained
25.9% of the variance in symptoms of depression (F ¼ 13.73, p ¼ .00).
Table 6 shows the summary statistics for the regression analysis in which
the relationships between the variables were investigated. Physical functioning emerged as a significant predictor of symptoms of depression in the
first model (p < .001). In the second model, we identified physical functioning (p < .001), feelings about the medical profession (p ¼ .02), and
sexual relationships (p ¼ .03) as significant predictors of symptoms

Discussion

We found that participants reported elevated symptoms of depression, with
43.1% reporting moderate to severe symptoms of depression. This finding
is in keeping with other studies related to symptoms of depression in
women with endometriosis (Chen et al., 2016; Lagana et al., 2015; Sepulcri
& Amaral, 2009); patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Campos, Silva, de
Castro, & Graminha, 2013; Imran et al., 2015), and patients with fibromyalgia (Lee et al., 2017). However, we found that a higher proportion of our
sample reported elevated depression compared to that of a Hungarian
study in which 20.3% of participants reported symptoms of depression
(Marki, Bokor, Rig
o, & Rig
o, 2017). This difference may be attributed to
contextual differences between the two countries, such as differences in the
health-care systems. We therefore compared our finding with research on
depression in South Africa. The South African Stress and Health study
found a prevalence of 9.8% of major depressive disorder among a general
South African sample (Herman et al., 2009). Our findings indicate that
patients with endometriosis experience greater levels of distress than the
general population. However, our study used a screening tool for depressive
symptoms, the BDI, whereas the SASH study used a diagnostic interview,
the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. This means that the

320

R. ROOMANEY ET AL.

20.3% of our sample who scored in the moderate and severe range on the
BDI may not necessarily receive a diagnosis of major depressive disorder if
followed up with a diagnostic interview. These findings are somewhat better than those of a study conducted among 481 patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain, in which 73.3% of participants reported moderate to
severe depression using the BDI II (Harris & D’Eon, 2008). This finding
should be interpreted with caution, as the participants were recruited from
a rehabilitation center, and could therefore have experience more pain than
patients with musculoskeletal pain who did not require treatment. It should
also be noted that the BDI includes physical symptoms, such as fatigue,
loss of energy, changes in eating and sleeping patterns; which could be
related to participants’ medical condition and this may impact findings.
We also found that physical functioning, feelings about the medical profession and sexual relationships were significant predictors of symptoms of
depression. Physical functioning was the strongest predictor of symptoms of
depression in our study. The relationship between depressive symptoms and
physical functioning is complex, as it is bidirectional. Some theories posit
that depression leads to poor physical functioning, whereas other theories
state that poor physical functioning can result in depression (Stegenga et al.,
2012). However, the findings of their longitudinal research indicate that
physical functioning is a stronger predictor of depression than the converse
(Stegenga et al., 2012). Studies show that women diagnosed with endometriosis report that their pain limited their physical functioning (Jones et al.,
2004; Moradi et al., 2014; Petrelluzzi et al., 2008). While other studies demonstrate the relationship between pain and depression (Facchin et al., 2015,
2017; Lorençatto et al., 2006; Marki et al., 2017), they did not explore the
role of physical functioning in depression. In our study, we found that poor
physical functioning predicted increased symptoms of depression.
The participants in our study reported fairly positive interactions with
medical professionals. We did not examine how long it took for participants to be diagnosed, as this is a well-known issue for patients
(Grundstr€
om, Alehagen, Kjølhede, & Berter€
o, 2018; Hudelist et al., 2012;
Husby, Haugen, & Moen, 2003; Staal, Van Der Zanden, & Nap, 2016). In
addition, we found that negative feelings about medical professionals predicted symptoms of depression among our participants. These negative
feelings related to (a) feeling that doctors were not helping patients, (b)
feeling that doctors thought that patients’ symptoms were exaggerated, (c)
feeling frustrated that doctors did not know enough about endometriosis to
help patients, and (d) feeling that patients were wasting their doctors’ time.
Patients with endometriosis frequently report poor relationships with medical professionals (Cox, Henderson, Wood, et al., 2003; Jones et al., 2004;
Moradi et al., 2014). However, no studies that we reviewed explored the

HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL

321

relationship between feelings about the medical profession and symptoms
of depression in women with endometriosis. Our findings are in keeping
with Bui et al. (2005) who found an association between patients’ dissatisfaction with their interactions with medical professionals and increasing
symptoms of depression. We found that patients who reported negative
feelings about the medical profession were more likely to report symptoms
of depression than those who did not report negative feelings. We consider
this an important finding because it does not relate directly to the physical
impact of the disease on women, but is indicative of women’s interactions
with others, in this case health-care professionals. Feeling dismissed by doctors or frustrated by health-care providers can affect the mental well-being
of patients and therefore health-care professionals should be cognizant of
their interactions with patients. This finding may also indicate that frustration with medical care could result in poor disease management and therefore poor physical functioning. Poor physical functioning may then result
in symptoms of depression among women with endometriosis. In addition,
the relationship between negative feelings about medical professionals and
depression could also be bidirectional, as women who experience depression might believe that they do not deserve the doctor’s time and attention,
and this may results in their feeling unworthy. This pathway awaits further
investigation. Considering the important role that medical professionals
play in patients’ experiences, interventions aimed at improving knowledge
of endometriosis and patient empathy and care among medical professionals may improve patient quality of life.
Feelings about sexual functioning was identified as the third predictor of
symptoms of depression in women with endometriosis. In our study, feelings about sexual functioning was conceptualized in terms of fear, pain,
guilt, avoidance, and frustration related to sexual intercourse. Research
shows that depression correlates with sexual dysfunction in women
(Toncev et al., 2015). Furthermore, the relationship between these variables
is considered to be bi-directional (i.e., depression may lead to avoidance
and guilt and problematic sexual relationships can lead to depression).
A similar study to ours also found that sexual dysfunction was a predictor
of depressive symptoms in women receiving hemodialysis (Santos et al.,
2013). Impaired sexual functioning may have wide-reaching implications
for women with endometriosis as it may have a negative impact on romantic relationships, self-esteem, and confidence (Ashing-Giwa et al., 2004;
Culley, Hudson, et al., 2013; Facchin et al., 2017; Fritzer et al., 2016;
Vercellini et al., 2012). Several treatment options are available for patients
with sexual dysfunction and these should be considered when managing
patient treatment. As sexual functioning is an important aspect of women’s
lives, interventions consisting of a combination of cognitive behavior

322

R. ROOMANEY ET AL.

therapy and pelvic floor therapy should be developed and evaluated. It has
also been recommended that multidisciplinary teams consisting of gynecologists, physiotherapists, sexologists, and psychologists may be beneficial to
patients with endometriosis and sexual dysfunction (Aerts et al., 2018).
While studies show that a relationship exists between psychological distress and infertility (Greil, McQuillan, Lowry, & Shreffler, 2011; Ogawa,
Takamatsu, & Horiguchi, 2011) and that infertility is an important concern
for women with endometriosis (Culley, Law, et al., 2013; Denny et al.,
2004; Markovic et al., 2008), we did not find that distress about infertility
predicted symptoms of depression. It is important to note that 24 participants (11.89%) in our study were seeking fertility treatment at the time of
the study. Fertility may therefore not have been a great concern among
our sample.
The identification of the above three predictors may have important
implications for health care among women with endometriosis. While the
study has identified these predictors, further investigations are required to
assess the pathways between these variables.

Limitations

We recruited participants through public tertiary hospitals and private
infertility clinics, and therefore our participants’ symptoms of endometriosis may have been worse than patients not seeking treatment at these sites.
Our selection strategy may have resulted in a skewed sample, as patients in
this study may have been more likely to experience poorer quality of life
than patients at regular gynecology practices. In addition, the cross-sectional research design did not allow us to examine the temporal relationship between variables.

Implications of the study/conclusion

We found that a large proportion of our sample reported elevated levels of
symptoms of depression. As none of our participants reported being previously diagnosed with depression, it indicates that in most cases depressive
symptoms have gone undetected. To this extent, we recommend that doctors enquire about patients’ mental well-being and refer patients for further
screening and treatment should they report depressive symptoms.
We also identified three predictors of depression among our sample. The
identification of these predictors may enable researchers and practitioners
to identify patients to be screened for depression, e.g., patients who report
sub-optimal physical functioning, negative feelings about the medical

HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL

323

profession, and difficult sexual relationships. In addition, the identification
of these new predictors may explain variability in patients’ mental health.
Sexual and physical functioning may be related to patient’s personal
experience of endometriosis itself. However, their level of satisfaction with
care is related to their relationships with health-care providers, specifically,
their perceptions of competence and empathy of their practitioners. It is
therefore important that doctors consider patients with endometriosis’ concerns in order to reduce distress among patients.
